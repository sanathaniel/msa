<p>Congratulations to this year's prize winners for the MSA's <a
		href="/msa/prizes/shortlist/">Book Prize</a>, <a
		href="/msa/prizes/first-book/">First Book Prize</a>, and the <a
		href="/msa/prizes/translation/">Translation
		Prize</a>.</p>
<p>Each year, the Modernist Studies Association seeks nominations for
	its Book Prize and its First Book Prize, awarded to books published
	in the previous year. Every other year, the MSA seeks nominations
	for its Edition, Anthology, or Collection Prize. Panels of judges
	coordinated by the Past President determine the books that made the
	most significant contributions to modernist studies. The winners
	each receive $1,000. A book first published in another year will not
	be eligible for the prize. This exclusion applies even if a new
	edition (paperback or revised, for example) was published in the
	award year.</p>
<p>Please visit our <a href="/msa/prizes/nominations">Nominations page</a>
	to recommend a book for this year's prize.<br /> Visit our <a
		href="/msa/prizes/previous-winners">archive</a> to see previous
	winners.</p>
