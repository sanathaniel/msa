	<strong>WINNER: Peter Kalliney, <em><a
				href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691230634/the-aesthetic-cold-war"
				target="_blank">The Aesthetic Cold War</a></em>
		(Princeton University Press, 2022)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Aesthetic Cold War is a major revision of our picture of Cold War
	aesthetics and politics, giving us a far more complex picture of old
	narratives of cultural co-option during literary decolonization.
	Kalliney’s is the new standard work on the relation of
	decolonial-era writers to Soviet realism, CIA funding, and cold war
	politics. He argues that many key debates in postcolonial studies —
	autonomy against political utility, indigeneity versus
	cosmopolitanism — were “formed in the crucible of the aesthetic cold
	war.” Taking up writers from Africa, China, the West Indies and
	elsewhere, this book is an astonishing archival achievement, mixing
	new findings about the origins of the major literary movements of
	the decolonial and postcolonial periods with detailed readings of
	key literary figures, alongside the files of the intelligence
	agencies who cultivated them (and whom they used in turn). Kalliney
	finally argues that decolonial and postcolonial-era writers, rather
	than dupes of either socialist realism or CIA-backed “cultural
	freedom,” were "canny operators" who played one side of the Cold War
	against the other. As he does so, he makes an eloquent case against
	the naivété of ideological and social determinism in political
	readings of de- and post-colonial writers now.</p>

	<strong>HONORABLE MENTION: Michael Lucey, <em><a
				href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo130500168.html"
				target="_blank">What Proust Heard: Novels and the
				Ethnography of Talk</a></em> (University of Chicago
		Press, 2022)</strong>
<p>What Proust Heard is an astonishing linguistic experiment in the
	monograph form, by the way of "language-in-use" in Proust. Lucey
	argues that a linguistic-anthropological approach to talking in the
		<em>Search</em> forces us to rethink reported speech in George
	Eliot, Dostoyevsky, Natalie Sarraute, and the enigmatic narrator of
	Rachel Cusk’s <em>Outline</em> trilogy, as well as our own talking
	about talk. In addition to a searching exploration of social data
	and listening as ethnology in Proust, Lucey’s book brings into
	conversation several fields of the social sciences, from literary
	sociology to anthropology to Bourdieu’s lectures on artistic
	distinction. Continually translating between languages, moving
	fluidly from Proust’s own post-aristocratic moment to our own idiom,
	Lucey writes with the eye and ear of a great essayist. <em>What
		Proust Heard</em> enacts its argument about Proust’s practice of
	listening through its own immersion in the speech and thinking of
	others, in a tour-de-force of essayistic close reading and close
	hearing.</p>

	<strong>Bette London, <em><a href="">Posthumous Lives: World War I
				and the Culture of Memory</a></em> (Cornell University
		Press, 2022) </strong>
</p>
<p><em>Posthumous Lives</em> is an innovative and beautifully written
	cultural history of the afterlife of World War I and its
	commemoration in Britain. Bette London addresses an exciting range
	of materials, archives, and forms in her exploration of the culture
	of war memory, including centennial celebrations, private
	commemorative volumes, the “War Poets” and the strange attachment to
	the figure of C. H. Sorley, Virginia Woolf’s counter-memorial
	archive in <em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, and contemporary memorials
	to soldiers “shot at dawn” by their own officers. As she does so,
	she brings to light both the uses of historical war memory and the
	war over historical memory itself. “What are the consequences,” she
	asks, “of investing in the posthumous life as the governing
	structure of memorialization?” <em>Posthumous Lives</em> is a lucid,
	poised, unsentimental reconsideration of an entire way of
	remembering, challenging our continuing attachment to certain
	posthumous memories at the expense of others. </p>

				target="_blank">Alain Locke and the Visual Arts</a></em>
		(Yale University Press, 2022)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Alain Locke and the Visual Arts</em> is a visually stunning and
	deeply learned re-reading of Locke as a cultural and also artistic
	theorist of Black arts across the whole span of his career. Mercer
	places Locke within the context of a larger exploration of Black
	aesthetic culture and signification, moving easily from a renovation
	of Locke’s culturalism to his role in establishing an
	“Afro-modernist” aesthetic to the question of Locke’s sexuality and
	the “Homo Negro” in art. Mercer’s book is a major contribution to
	the culturalist re-thinking of the Renaissance and its aftermath
	across media forms and moments of institutionalization. <em>Alain
		Locke and the Visual Arts</em> is beautifully written and
	gorgeously illustrated with an astonishing archive of “Afromodern”
	art, sculpture, and photographs, with which both Locke and Mercer
	are in conversation. This book justifies Locke’s faith in the
	African and modernist art criticism to come. </p>

	<strong>Arthur Rose, <em><a
				href="https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-asbestos-the-last-modernist-object.html"
				target="_blank">Asbestos–The Last Modernist
			Object</a></em> (Edinburgh University Press, 2022)</strong>
</p>
<p>This surprising and original history of asbestos offers a compelling
	investigation of the material as a modernist object. The book shows
	us what literary criticism can do differently in attending to
	material life, giving us accounts of various historical, literary,
	and biographical accounts of literary figures’ encounters with
	asbestos, but also a reckoning with a family history of South
	African asbestos mining. To write about asbestos, Rose tells us, is
	to write about its use. It is also, as he makes abundantly clear, to
	write not just about its toxic legacy, but about its utopian promise
	to insulate the future from a possible risk, which carries all the
	dangers inherent to such a technological and capitalist idea. Rose
	shows how paying extraordinarily minute literary critical attention
	to one single material – its history, its associations, its rich
	potential for narrative – can cast light on swathes of cultural
	history; <em>Asbestos – The Last Modernist Object</em> offers a
	fascinating movement between medical, personal and literary spaces.
	Indeed, asbestos offers Rose a subject ripe for a Latourian account
	of its treatment as not just a substance, but as metaphor; for
	latent potential, for resource extraction, and for our understanding
	of waste; and as a material object with a degree of complex and
	ambivalent animacy or liveliness. In doing so the book tracks
	asbestos’s movement across entire domains of cultural and
	epistemological space. Recasting its positioning as a banned
	substance, Rose explores what happens to asbestos even as his
	account acknowledges that it cannot undo the material history of its
	creation and use. ‘We must work out ways to endure asbestos time’,
	he writes, and in doing so, the book shows us a new way of
	understanding the history of substances via the methods of literary
	scholarship.</p>

				target="_blank">The Persistence of Realism in Modernist
				Fiction</a></em> (Cambridge University Press, 2022)
	</strong>
</p>
<p> Paul Stasi’s <em>The Persistence of Realism in Modernist
		Fiction</em>, a thorough defense of the insuperable dialectic of
	realism and modernism within all modernist-era fiction, achieves
	something very rare. Engaging the entrenched conflict between
	partisans of modernism and realism, it manages to not only say
	something new, but to offer brilliant readings of some of
	modernism’s central figures. His question is simple, even while the
	answer cannot be: was modernism a rejection of realism, or a
	development from it? Does it represent continuity or rupture? For
	Stasi, realism persists – not merely in the period, but in the very
	texts that are held up as axiomatically anti-realist, and its formal
	concerns cannot ever be seen as separate from those which have
	always animated realism. The way through this argument is laced with
	landmines – the potential for creating strawmen or simplifications
	is clear – but Stasi’s book is an exemplar of a clear and compelling
	argument, one that sets out to change minds and cast light on the
	period and on the individual texts from <em>Ulysses</em> to <em>The
		Years</em> to <em>Invisible Man</em>, all of which he
	close-reads with huge skill.</p>

					target="_blank">Aleksandr Rodchenko: Photography in
					the Time of Stalin</a></em> (Yale University Press,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Aglaya Glebova’s elegant study of Aleksandr Rodchenko’s “shadow
		oeuvre” has the feel of an instant classic. At once subtle and
		ambitious, the book illuminates an era—that of the first Five
		Year Plans (1928-1938)—in a way that will engage both art
		historians and literary scholars. Through the lens of the single
		artist study, Glebova shows how, despite their origin in
		government propaganda efforts, Rodchenko’s knotty, eclectic
		images fail to correspond to the ideal of the new Soviet
		citizen. Focusing her critical gaze on an aesthetics of
		prolongation and dwelling rather than action, and on the porous
		and provisional, rather than crisis or rupture, Glebova
		defamiliarizes a set of photographic concepts (perspective,
		color, instantaneity, montage) and art historical categories,
		from portraiture and landscape to the photo essay and album.
			<em>Aleksandr Rodchenko: Photography in the Time of
			Stalin</em> reconsiders the relation of art to
		totalitarianism, elucidating a variety of “paths and
		potentialities” beyond mere complicity, and asking how
		photography might “hold open the vicissitudes of a moment.”</p>

					target="_blank">Stevie Smith and the Aphorism: Hard
					Language</a></em> (Oxford University Press,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>One wouldn’t expect a book tightly focused on a single poet and a
		small form to feel expansive, but this is precisely the case
		with Noreen Masud’s delightful and inventive <em>Stevie Smith
			and the Aphorism: Hard Language</em>. Aphorism, in Masud’s
		astute theorization, offers a “safe form” for dangerous feeling,
		lingering at the “edge of conversation” and accommodating
		“femaleness, queerness, illness, outsiderhood, and
		unhearability.” With its “acrobatics of display and effacement,”
		aphoristic poetry functions as a “self-concealing mode of
		protest.” Each chapter interweaves Smith’s poetry with her
		drawings, exploring various sources of aphoristic contradiction,
		including classics, proverbs, etiquette guides, refrains,
		quotations, fairytales, captions, and fragments. The book wears
		its feminism lightly, dodging the logic of subversion and
		considering the complexity of midcentury women’s writing via
		Smith’s vexed relation to the “appropriate” and her conjunction
		of waste and frugality, significance and dismissibility. One
		need not be versed in Stevie Smith or even in poetry to love
		reading this quirky and surprising book. </p>

					target="_blank">Troubling Late Modernism: Ethics,
					Feeling, and the Novel Form</a></em> (Oxford
			University Press, 2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Troubling Late Modernism</em> troubled us as critics, in
		challenging and exciting ways. The authors Doug Battersby
		examines look back on the developments of modernist literary
		form—its ability to align readers’ perspectives with characters,
		the deciphering demands it places on readers—and say something
		like: <em>This is a powerful narrative tool—and perhaps an evil
			one?</em> Through dazzlingly precise, detailed, and
		convincing close readings, Battersby examines the ways these
		authors put us as readers in morally compromised—or
		victimized—positions. Nabokov sets up the reader like a victim
		of harassment, made to feel perversely complicit when she
		imputes a sexual meaning to language; Morrison’s novels offer
		“enforced intimacies.” Often merely trying to understand a novel
		seems to require the reader to participate in an eroticizing
		impulse that might be morally monstrous. Battersby refuses to
		accede to the critical tendency to convert erotic descriptions
		of abused women into philosophical problems about the nature of
		language, asking us, instead, to see close reading as an ethical
		practice—indeed, the only practice capable of exposing and doing
		justice to the most intense and disturbing elements of modernist
		form.</p>

					target="_blank">The Idea of Indian Literature:
					Gender, Genre, and Comparative Method</a></em>
			(Northwestern University Press/FlashPoints, 2022) </strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>The Idea of Indian Literature</em> offers an exciting
		approach to both world literature and comparative literature.
		The book advances a new methodology that unhooks national
		literature from language, attending instead to anti-vernacular
		projects of regional and national literature in India. This
		precise and detailed study moves among Hindi, Tamil, and
		Anglophone literature to advance an understanding of world
		literature grounded not in a fixed corpus but, rather, in a
		dynamic method of worlding: responses to shifting understandings
		of literary value, constructions of literary history, and
		emergent understandings of readership. In this expansive
		theorization of modernism, the undertheorized realist short
		story, with its persistent tropes of a feminized modernity,
		emerges as a powerful new site. The author reveals a utopian
		cosmopolitanism that emerges with and through regional and
		national frames, moving beyond critiques of world literature as
		essentially European or Western. Lucid and ambitious, this book
		ends with a provocative coda, “Ten Theses on Indian Literature,”
		which offers fresh insights to scholars of gender, translation,
		global modernisms, postcolonial studies, and the institutional
		turn in literary studies. </p>

	</p>
	<p>We’re perhaps a little too quick to tell stories in which the
		idea of data, or of documentation, marks a form of epistemic
		violence imposed on African American life by white outsiders—or
		so Autumn Womack argues, declaring that, by contrast, “data is
		not this book’s antagonist.” Charting a rigorous, artful course
		between two equally unsatisfying extremes—black sociability as
		fundamentally undocumentable in its fugitive quality on the one
		hand; the fantasy of unimpeachably good data on the other—<em>The
		Matter of Black Living</em> demonstrates, via original and compelling
		archival analysis, the ways African American people have seen in
		data a horizon for their own creative practice. Despite the
		pervasiveness of a white documentary gaze, the forms of data
		Womack examines—the social survey, photographs of lynching
		survivors, documentary film—persistently reveal African American
		subjects and artists as analysts and users of documentation
		technology itself, drawing our attention to the ways these
		formats can point our attention to their own limitations. The
		book ends by asking: “how to document the sociality of black
		life?” The history it tells ensures that we understand the
		effort to do so as an integral part of the history of black
		modernist art.</p>

			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>The <em>Routledge Handbook of North American Indigenous
			Modernisms</em> explores Indigenous lives, literatures, and
		cultural productions in North American from the late nineteenth
		and early twentieth centuries. The volume crucially reshapes
		canonicity in this period, attending to the ways that, in
		contributor Philip J. Deloria’s words, “Indigenous Modernism
		transformed the modern itself.” Chapters are exemplary for their
		interdisciplinary scope and transnational juxtapositions, taking
		up the ties between Indigenous and Black communities in the
		Mississippi Delta, oral histories of the General Allotment Act,
		representations of indigeneity in Caribbean print cultures, and
		the Alaska Native solidarity networks, amongst other historical
		and political constellations. The volume highlights key figures
		of Indigenous cultural production and activism, including
		Zitkála-Šá, Lynn Riggs, Paul Green, Henry Starr, Mourning Dove,
		John Joseph Mathews, Joy Harjo, and Kent Monkman. Insisting upon
		the centrality of settler-colonial dispossession to any
		accounting of the modern, alongside longstanding histories of
		native survivance, this powerful account of Indigenous thought
		and action will be an essential resource for scholars and

	</p>
	<p><em>Time for Reparations</em> is an intervention that the New

		unrepaired past injustice”— the long-lasting pain that various
		nations, peoples, and communities endure. This collection raises
		questions that will help reorient the theoretical and historical
		horizons of the New Modernist Studies. For example: how do past
		injustices transmit across generations and shape present
		disempowerment? What are responsible and effective forms of
		reparation? How does activist scholarship link the histories of
		injustices to contemporary political changes? Through these
		questions, <em>Time for Reparations</em> traces how the past
		remains central to current injustices through four topical
		sections—“Addressing the Legacy of Slavery,” “Reparations:
		Precedents and Lessons Learned,” and “Outstanding Issues:
		Unrepaired State-Sponsored Collective Injustice,” and “Ways
		Forward for Reparations.” <em>Time for Reparations</em>
		catalyzes a fundamental shift of conceptual frameworks in
		approaching twentieth-century political and cultural histories.

					target="_blank">A History of the Harlem
					Renaissance</a></em> (Cambridge University Press,
			2021)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Rachel Farebrother and Miriam Thaggert’s <em>A History of the
			Harlem Renaissance</em> is an exceptionally thoughtful
		volume that brings fresh perspective to a much-studied period of
		literary innovation. The titular qualifier that announces this
		as a history, rather than the history, acknowledges the
		contributions to the field that have preceded it, and sets off
		the work of this volume as additive, or, as the editors put it
		in their introduction, as participating in “a long tradition of
		revising, re-reading, and remaking the Harlem Renaissance” (11).
		It makes welcome additions and revisions indeed, both bringing
		new texts into the spotlight and refocusing scholarly attention
		on form and genre in particular. Bringing together literature
		with visual culture, popular culture, dance, and music, the book
		covers well-known genres and also exceeds them to attend to
		biography, bildungsroman, roman à clef, children’s literature,
		short story, film, and more. The volume is not only an
		introduction to the literature and history of the period, but
		also to the histories, theories, and methodologies of the
		scholarship that has been published about it. The editors’
		introduction usefully outlines the ways in which African
		American literary criticism and black studies more broadly can
		be historicised by attending to the ways that the stakes of the
		field have been articulated through iterative reevaluations of
		the cultural production of the Harlem Renaissance period, and an
		afterword by Deborah McDowell assesses what the scholarship
		collected here portends for the future of the field. Across four
		sections of critical essays engaged with “Re-Reading,”
		“Experimenting,” “Re-Mapping,” and “Performing” the New Negro,
		the contributors offer exceptionally incisive and insightful
		considerations, both deep and wide-ranging, of the history and
		legacy of this influential movement in African American literary
		history.<br /><br />

			State University Press, 2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Radical Dreams: Surrealism, Counterculture, Resistance</em>
		shifts the traditional timeline of the surrealist movement,
		moving beyond the interwar period to the 1960s, 1970s, and
		1980s. This shift highlights the ties between a surrealist
		aesthetic and radical politics, turning to the affinity groups,
		underground subcultures, and student protest movements that
		pronounced a commitment to surrealism as a mode of
		anti-authoritarian resistance. A reconsideration of “Surrealism
		as Radicalism,” as the introductory essay posits, leads to a
		suite of essays that are particularly impressive for their
		interdisciplinary breadth and transnational contours. Chapters
		turn to the student protests of May ’68, Afrosurrealism, the
		Situationist International, the Wobblies, and London punk. New
		constellations emerge through the juxtaposition of a variety of
		artists and political actors, including Charles Fourier, Roberto
		Matta, Robert Rauschenberg, and Ted Joans. Drawing out the
		interactions between late surrealist currents and a variety of
		New Left political formations, spanning the sexual revolution to
			<em>Earth First!</em>, this volume importantly reshapes the
		historical contours of surrealism’s legacy.<br /><br /></p>

			</a></em>(Chicago)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Rachel Sagner Buurma and Laura Heffernan’s <i>The Teaching
		Archive</i> radically reconfigures our understanding of the
		discipline and study of English by tracing its historical trajectory
		through the collaborative work of the literature classroom. Grounded
		in extensive archival research, the authors vividly reconstruct the
		teaching practices of instructors both well-known (T.S. Eliot,
		Edmund Wilson) and obscure (J. Saunders Redding, Josephine Miles) in
		order to demonstrate the ways that students and professors far
		outside the confines of elite academia helped to elaborate key
		disciplinary frameworks and methods. Collectively, their empirical
		accounts of classroom praxis and close analyses of course materials
		challenge longstanding oppositions—between formalism and
		historicism, or teaching and research—too often perceived as
		entrenched. In the process, the authors also uncover pedagogical
		“innovations” like student-centered learning, culturally responsive
		pedagogy, and distant reading within these early and
		mid-20th-century classrooms, revealing that radical experimentation
		has both been a persistent feature of literature education and one
		that has flourished within the broadest possible range of
		institutions. A beautifully written and forcefully argued book,
		<i>The Teaching Archive</i> will be essential reading for
		literature scholars and teachers. By recovering this lost
		disciplinary past, Buurma and Heffernan equip readers with a
		necessary tool to rebuke prevailing accounts of literary studies
		that, the authors show, are as inaccurate as they are expedient.</p>

			</a></em>(University of Minnesota Press)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Brooks Hefner’s <i>Black Pulp</i> is both a remarkable work of
		recovery and an important argument about African American literature
		in the modernist period. By locating Black pulp fiction in race
		newspapers such as the <i>Pittsburgh Courier</i> and the
		<i>Baltimore Afro-American</i>, Hefner offers an account of
		Black genre fiction that differs significantly from the highbrow
		African American magazines and the uplift and protest fiction with
		which scholars are most familiar. Across a myriad of genres—romance,
		speculative fiction, adventure stories—Hefner identifies the dual
		pleasures Black pulp stories offered their audiences: both the
		pleasures of genre fiction (including happy endings) and the
		pleasures of imagining racial justice and retribution during Jim
		Crow. In addition to opening an archive of understudied and unknown
		authors and texts (one notable exception being George Schuyler),
		<i>Black Pulp</i> also offers the important contribution of
		identifying Black fiction that was solely marketed and consumed by
		Black audiences. This is a generous and important work that will
		prove vital to those working in African American literature or those
		seeking a prehistory to the contemporary renaissance of Black genre

	</p>
	<p>If weak theory in recent years has shown itself to de-center familiar

		<i>Modernity for the Masses</i> is weak modernism at its

		city’s exploding population, European modernism, and state power.
		León’s fine-grained attention to Bonet’s evolving plans for housing
		the population of Buenos Aires amidst dramatic political upheavals
		gives us an entirely new history of “the masses,” one that narrates
		the complex negotiations between architects and politicians to
		control, manage, and harness the power of this emergent group in

				>Art Cinema and India’s Forgotten Futures: Film and
				History in the Post-Colony </a></em>(Columbia University
			Press)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>In Rochona Majumdar’s powerful and persuasive new study, Indian art
		cinema emerges as nothing less than a prism refracting the nation’s
		conflicting apprehensions of its past and aspirations for its
		future. With a bivalent focus on “the history of art cinema and the
		art cinema as history,” <i>Art Cinema and India’s Forgotten
			Futures</i> focuses on the work of three major directors—Ritwik
		Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, and Satyajit Ray—in order to illuminate the ways
		in which the cinema of these diverse filmmakers was made to bear the
		“ideological burdens” of a tumultuous post-colonial present.
		Majumdar produces a richly nuanced account of the aesthetic,
		intellectual, and historiographic ambitions of the three directors,
		offering tour-de-force analyses of their films, including both the
		more familiar (Ghatak’s <i>Cloud-Capped Star</i>, Ray’s Apu trilogy)
		and the less studied (Sen’s Calcutta trilogy, Ray’s city films). In
		the process, she usefully complicates assumptions not only about
		“new” Indian cinema, but about the category of art cinema broadly.
		Thus, even as Majumdar provides a meticulously researched account of
		art cinema’s function within a specific historical moment and
		national context, her central, well-substantiated claim—that “art
		films themselves [are] a mode of historical apprehension”—is one
		with far-reaching implications for scholars in the fields of film
		studies, post-colonial studies, and modernist studies.</p>

	<p>A significant work of film theory, Daniel Morgan’s <i>The Lure of the

		rehearses) film theory’s long history of grounding conceptions of
		film meaning in montage, and trains us instead on camera motion. In
		doing so, he overturns a fundamental assumption about the camera as
		the locus of audience identification that has grounded much film
		theory. Instead, by first considering moments of perceptual games
		(such as the play with identification with the killer in horror
		films) and then articulating more complex challenges such as Ophüls’
		circling camera or Terrence Malick’s “antiperspectival”
		cinematography, Morgan opens up the spectator’s <i>relationship</i>
		to the moving camera as a significant aspect of film style.
		Specifically, he argues that the relationship is one characterized
		by epistemic fantasy, as viewers imagine taking on but do not lose
		themselves to the perspectives offered by camera movement. <i>The

		</p>
		<p><i>Making Liberalism New</i> turns to a fascinating group of

			liberalism as a discursive formation rather than a collection of

			</a></em>(Chicago)</strong>
		</p>
		<p><i>Modern Art and the Remaking of Human Disposition</i> is a
			formalist tour de force that returns – as if for the first time
			– to the late nineteenth century decades in which modern artists
			abandoned classical conventions for posing human figures in

			consciousness it served to indicate, modern painters and
			choreographers portrayed the human form as stiff, its gestures
			uniform, its fingers and toes disarticulated. Butterfield-Rosen
			illuminates the implications of this new postural simplicity,
			which heralded multiple twentieth century varieties of visual

			writers formed the basis of key works of literary modernism,
			from Symbolist poetry to Aubrey Beardsley’s illustrations, Djuna
			Barnes’s short stories, Yeats’s dance dramas, and Beckett’s late

		</p>
		<p><i>The Intelligent Unconscious in Modernist Literature and

			influential formulations of the Freudian model of nonconscious
			intellection, Trigoni shows how central were ideas of

			development of non-Freudian psychology. The <i>Intelligent
				Unconscious</i> also demonstrates how major modernist
			thinkers and writers like T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and D. H.

		<p><i>The Obsolete Empire</i> explores the history of modern

		</p>
		<p>Alys Moody and Stephen J. Ross’s <i>Global Modernists on
			Modernism</i> is a groundbreaking anthology that will have
			an immeasurable impact. It introduces carefully selected,
			edited, and annotated texts from a breathtakingly broad range of

			the anthology has been to modernism, or as they put it, how
			“this process of assemblage and collection, of triage and
			sorting, has been central to the history of modernism’s
			reception.” In this way the volume, both in its editorial
			choices and its expert critical essays, offers a radical shift
			away from the discipline’s preoccupation with defining
			modernism, and instead aims to present an archive from which we
			might begin to understand the ways in which modernism has been
			differently understood around the world. As such it also seeks
			to “go beyond merely gesturing to the existence of modernists
			around the world, to defend the value of ‘global modernism’ as a
			critical hermeneutic.” The anthology begins with the brilliant
			and provocative “Ten Theses on Global Modernism”, providing a
			thematic “Alternate Table of Contents” with categories ranging
			from “Political and Social Formations” to “Artistic Movements
			and Styles” and “Institutions and Social Conditions of the
			Field.” In addition to drawing on Moody and Ross’s expertise,

				>Modernism and Close Reading</a></em> (Oxford
				University Press)</strong>
		</p>
		<p>This landmark collection of essays takes the seemingly
			established combination of modernism and close-reading and
			probes it until new conceptual and theoretical genealogies
			emerge. Putting pressure on disciplinary assumptions, it
			examines and interrogates close reading’s privileged relation to
			modernism, suggesting that this affiliation no longer seems as
			inarguable as it once did. Putting these in conjunction – with
			full acknowledgement of both contemporary methodologies and the
			shifting commitments of both ‘modernism’, and ‘close-reading’ –
			proves enormously fruitful, and James’s introduction enriches
			and stimulates our understanding of these overlapping terms.
			Marshalling a joyfully diverse range of approaches and examples,
			the essays in this book, each sensational on its own terms, take
			the question in unexpected and imaginative directions. The book
			is divided into two sections. First is a history of modernist
			close-reading, which offers a magisterial but never linear
			narrative account of critical practice, always showing an
			alertness to the contingencies and contradictions therein. The
			second section, ‘Futures for Close Reading Modernism’, expands
			its purview to include ways closeness of reading, and the
			closeness – or distance – of modernism, are vital for critics
			today. This is a book with real things to say about the history
			of criticism, the quality of attentiveness, and their
			relationship to the practice and study of modernism right now.
			It is going to be an inescapable book for some time to
			come.<br /><br /></p>

		</p>
		<p>This exceptionally elegant volume gathers together new essays on

			new thinking about print and media cultures, and the expansion
			of modernist studies more generally. The editors take their
			title from Barnes’s line that ‘there is always more surface to a

				>Cathay: A Critical Edition by Ezra Pound</a></em>
				(Fordham University Press)</strong>
		</p>
		<p><i>Cathay</i>, the slim volume of poems that Ezra Pound
			“translated” from classical Chinese in 1915, has long been
			considered one of Pound’s crowning achievements and a
			cornerstone of modernism itself. Because Pound himself did not
			know Chinese and relied upon notes left behind by the American
			scholar Ernest Fenollosa to compose his own idiosyncratic
			versions, the collection has also been controversial from the
			start, spawning a century of fierce debate over the merits and
			flaws of Pound’s translations, modernism’s problematic
			engagement in cultural appropriation and Orientalism, and the
			practice and goals of translation itself. Enter this
			groundbreaking new critical edition, which, for the first time,
			presents Pound’s lapidary, moving poems alongside the original
			source material he drew upon to create <i>Cathay</i>. Thanks to
			Timothy Billings’ exhaustive editorial and archival efforts
			(including his heroic decoding of Fenollosa’s notoriously
			inscrutable handwriting), the famous “cribs” found in
			Fenollosa’s notebooks have been made available at last,
			transcribed and presented in a well-conceived, easy-to-use
			format. Instantly indispensable, this book will prove to be a
			pivotal moment in the history of <i>Cathay</i>’s reception. With
			three substantial scholarly introductions and meticulous,
			enlightening line-by-line glosses and detailed annotations, this
			beautifully-designed book wades sensitively into decades of
			contentious disagreement, error, and misunderstanding. As this
			edition brilliantly demonstrates, the poems of <i>Cathay</i> are
			less the work of one gifted, controversial American poet but
			rather the product of a fascinating chain of transmission – an
			elaborate game of telephone -- that crosses centuries, multiple
			languages, cultures, and far-flung continents. Immensely
			entertaining, insightful, and deeply learned, Billings is a
			consummate guide to the complexities and nuances of “the
			<i>Cathay</i> problem.” This dazzling, revelatory book is
			not only a goldmine for scholars of Pound and modernist poetry,
			but for anyone interested in either the theory and practice of
			translation or the story of how modernism emerges from densely
			interwoven, global networks of encounter and exchange.

					>Modernism and the Meaning of Corporate
				Persons</a></em> (Oxford University Press)</strong></p>
	<p>“They do everything people do—except breathe, die and go to jail
		for dumping 1.3 million pounds of PCBs in the Hudson River.” You
		may recognize this characterization of corporations from the
		satire of Stephen Colbert, but it is Lisa Siraganian who
		unearths the legal and literary foundations of corporate
		personality in her extraordinary <i>Modernism and the Meaning of
			Corporate Persons</i>. Siraganian’s study opens with the
		1886 United States Supreme Court ruling that businesses could
		function as legal actors in a system historically reserved for
		property-holding human beings. This decision to attribute
		“personality” to corporations inaugurates a series of
		eye-opening questions about the possibility and potential
		meanings of collective intention. Siraganian assembles a
		fascinating and highly original archive that includes the legal
		theory of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Harold Laski, and Frederic
		Maitland alongside the literary works of Frank Norris, F. Scott
		Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Muriel Rukeyser, and Ralph Ellison.
		The first half of the book stages ontological questions about
		corporations as collective social agents beginning with the
		puzzle of discerning intention, the nature of corporate speech,
		and the operations of the corporate mind (if indeed such a thing
		exists). The second half looks to lawyers and artists who track
		the often appalling real world effects of corporate personhood
		through such protections as limited liability and the distortion
		of Fourteenth Amendment rights. Modernist literature emerges in
		Siraganian’s study as an essential resource for addressing
		philosophical questions of collective intention that the courts
		had to resolve in pragmatic terms. The brilliance of Modernism
		and the Meaning of Corporate Persons lies in its dedicated
		multidisciplinarity. Siraganian honors the means and ends of the
		law, literature, and philosophy and uses their disparate ways of
		thinking, feeling, and reasoning to illuminate the soulless
		corporation in all its unnatural personhood.</p>

	<p>Sarah Cole’s <i>Inventing Tomorrow</i> is no conventional
		single-author book. But then Wells was no conventional single
		author. That Cole expertly synthesizes the vast range of Wells’s
		massive output is not the least of this volume’s virtues; that
		she makes us understand what we have missed out on by neglecting
		Wells, or acceding to his disparagement, is perhaps its
		greatest. “Wells’s peers recognized that he had the boldest of
		agendas for his writing, scaled to the world,” notes Cole—an
		agenda that, obscured by the “astonishing success” and longevity
		of modernist values, represents both the road not taken in
		twentieth-century literature and a vital missing piece in our

			Press)</strong></p>
	<p>Written with clarity and boldness, Anneka Lenssen’s <i>Beautiful
			Agitation</i> draws on impressive archival research in
		showing how vitalist philosophies of life animated the work of
		Syrian artists and artist–activists between 1900 and 1965. For
		Kahlil Gibran, Adham Ismail, and Fateh al-Moudarres, among
		others, brushes and pencils could be used to disclose—or gesture
		toward—the undulations of immanent energies and unseen forces
		that subtend the painted object. This reservoir of agitating
		life forces, as Lenssen shows with theoretical subtlety, could
		spill over into political agitation, not least as it prompted a
		recognition of the collectives and flows that comprised the
		modern nation. Deeply historicized and yet also eschewing a
		reductively “contextualist” approach to Syrian art, Lenssen’s
		case studies hinge on insightful close readings of a range of
		palimpsestic, multivalent paintings as well as sketches and
		drawings, and they model a cyclical rather than progressive or
		hierarchical account of the global development of modern art.
		Thus <i>Beautiful Agitation</i> agitates—beautifully—our
		understanding of modernist form, philosophy, and

	<p>From the comfortable vantage of one of Charles and Ray Eames’s
		chairs—molded of plywood or fiberglass or covered, perhaps, in
		soft leather—Justus Nieland’s <i>Happiness by Design</i>
		reimagines mid-century modernism via the media practices of its

		experimentation at mid-century in a body of understudied films
		and multimedia products produced by the Eameses and their peers.
		Examined in meticulous detail, this fascinating archive is the
		grounds for Nieland’s new and often surprising cultural history
		of modernism—a modernism in which art and design are caught up
		with corporations and institutions, including the university, as
		they develop techniques of happiness or “the good life” through

	<p>It’s almost impossible to detach Elizabeth Outka’s <i>Viral

		literature—its effect on how we will now forever read works we
		thought we knew by heart derives purely from Outka’s remarkable
		sensitivity to text. Arguing for the unacknowledged significance
		of the pandemic, the mountain of dead occluded by the more
		“grievable” and public losses of the First World War, she calls
		up the ghosts at the heart of <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>, <i>The Waste

	<p>This fascinating, wide-ranging study considers the coincidence of

		of women’s work and queer work. Richards combines an expansive
		geographic and linguistic scope with meticulous attention to the
		formal details of the book's multi-genre archives: from
		pamphlets and magazines to photographs, plays, novels,

				>Make It the Same: Poetry in the Age of Global Media
			</a></em>(Columbia University Press, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>To praise the originality of Jacob Edmond’s account of modern poetry
	might sound rather ironic given the premise of the book, but the
	sheer ingenuity on display—as Edmond assembles poets from dozens of
	countries, poems in multiple platforms, and a dizzying array of
	technologies—is truly impressive. We now appreciate the
	unoriginality that Pound intended in “Make it new,” but Edmond shows
	how poetry can be reproduced, chopped, appropriated, hacked,
	retranslated, and otherwise remediated in ways that Pound could not
	have imagined in the pre-digital era. What this introduces, too, is
	a new velocity of reproduction and reproducibility: poetry
	circulates unoriginally—yet with great creativity—in an instant,
	Edmond shows, from the Caribbean to China to Russia to the United
	States and back in the blink of an eye. And it does so in wildly
	unexpected circuits: part of the book’s beauty is its ability to
	unpack putatively high and low forms, from the experimental
	avant-garde to cutup Twitter poems, in which poetry now travels. But
	there is nothing either Romantic or romantic about Edmond’s book;
	instead, it is a canny story of media itself in an age of Western
	dominance, of poetry’s imbrication in it and response to it, and of
	authors like M. NourbeSe Philip, Yi Sha, Caroline Bergvall, and
	Dmitri Prigov—along with many others—formulating and reformulating
	adaptable poetics that anonymous contributors around an unequal
	world continue to remix daily. The book therefore takes seriously
	its work to demystify, through its motif of the paradoxical “master
	copy,” our own enduring stories of originality that the media
	environments we inhabit every minute remind us must constantly be
	rethought.</p>

				>The Book of Minor Perverts: Sexology, Etiology, and the
				Emergences of Sexuality </a></em>(University of Chicago
		Press, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>Benjamin Kahan’s book is unlike many in modernist studies. Taking
	center stage are few major texts or figures from the era, but
	instead, the “thousand aberrant sexualities” (Foucault) that, over
	time, were reduced primarily to one all-encompassing, internally
	contradictory diagnosis of “homosexuality.” Kahan returns to the
	archives of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century sexology,
	where a host of charged and divergent figures with sexualities
	difficult to taxonomize and capture (necrophiliacs, nymphomaniacs,
	statue-fondlers) were scrutinized in journals and labs alike. This
	book’s well-researched and theoretically complex account unpacks the
	ways in which modern queer studies and sexuality studies have drawn
	on, contested, and revised the notions of emergence itself that were
	passed down from this era. Kahan engages with Sedgwick’s
	field-shaping legacy, but his primary focus is a question that
	Sedgwick did not take up, and that contemporary queer studies had
	largely avoided because of its implications for right-wing accounts
	of homosexual origins: the deep history of (pseudo-)genetic theories
	of same-sex etiologies. This book is a study of patterns,
	modalities, paradigms, and speciations as much as it is a study of
	forgotten novels, medical treatises, and psychology manuals. With
	verve and insight at every turn, Kahan tells the captivating story
	of figures lost to history, strays who have been cut out from grand
	narratives because they fit neither comfortably nor even
	uncomfortably in the ways we think about sexuality in the present.
	By recovering them, Kahan helps us recover a lost world of thought
	itself and the bodies that it once located in time and space.</p>

				>Artificial Color: Modern Food and Racial Fictions
			</a></em> (Oxford University Press, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Artificial Color</i>, Catherine Keyser brilliantly shows how
	critical eating studies advances our understanding of early
	twentieth century racial theories and their centrality to modern
	American fiction. Keyser assembles a rich archive that includes
	nutritional tracts, guides for food tourism, and raw food recipes as
	she demonstrates the depth and breadth of Harlem Renaissance and
	Lost Generation writers’ engagements with cultures and technologies
	of food. In inventive chapters on Jean Toomer, George Schuyler,
	Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald,
	Zora Neale Hurston, and Dorothy West, Keyser weaves together
	meticulous historical research, dazzling close readings, and
	trenchant engagements with contemporary theories of embodiment,
	materiality, race, and gender. She reveals how, in the era of Jim
	Crow segregation and the “one drop” rule, writers turned to food to
	generate alternative racial fictions that exposed the artificiality
	of whiteness but also the material force of white supremacy. In the
	process, she traces the racial history of soda bubbles, hydroponics,
	orange juice, foraged mushrooms, and processed meats as well as
	their place in the racial imaginaries of early twentieth century
	fiction. This sophisticated, incisive book explores literature’s
	capacity to imagine what might be, while detailing the intertwined
	histories of food and race that determined what was—and is. In our
	moment of flourishing “foodie” culture, resurgent white nationalism,
	and expansive Black protest, <i>Artificial Color</i> is a timely and
	important book. </p>

				>Black Land: Imperial Ethiopianism and African America
			</a></em> (Princeton University Press)</strong></p>
<p>In this field-changing book, Nadia Nurhussein brings together and
	reorients a remarkable number of important currents that modernist
	studies has alternately gathered and overlooked in the past two
	decades, from global solidarity movements to Black and Black
	diasporic studies. Nurhussein focuses on the real and imagined state
	of Ethiopia, an exceptional space in Africa in the early twentieth
	century that transfixed the minds of many Black writers. To Pauline
	Hopkins, Claude McKay, George Schuyler, Langston Hughes, and to
	their white counterparts and to many lesser-known figures, the
	anti-imperial empire Ethiopia represented a bewildering bundle of
	contradictions at once Biblical and futuristic. It was an idealized,
	mystical site that prompted Du Bois’s romantic wonder, the
	Rastafarian faith, the hypermasculine cultism around Haile Selassie,
	the dreamworld of Hopkins’s <i>Of One Blood</i>, and far away, even
	the notorious Dreadnought Hoaxers proclaimed themselves Abyssinians.
	Nurhussein follows not only the literature, but the vast array of
	cultural products that African American imaginings of Ethiopia
	yielded through its putative “originary blackness,” all juxtaposed
	with their responses to racialized violence in the United States.
	Nurhussein’s book seamlessly weaves together accounts of wars,
	philosophy, poetry, the Black press, visual archives, and much more;
	one is left in awe of the author’s ability to narrate this gripping,
	expansive story itself. And still, not to be taken for granted,
	Nurhussein brings to life—right now—her subjects, as agents
	attempting to work out urgent, complex, and ultimately unresolvable
	geopolitical contradictions through literature.</p>

				>Chromatic Modernity: Color, Cinema, and Media of the
				1920s </a></em> (Columbia University Press,
		2019)</strong></p>
<p>In this dynamic book, Sarah Street and Joshua Yumibe provide a
	sweeping account of how color became a hallmark of modernity in
	Europe and North America. While it is a cliché to describe the 1920s
	as bold and energetic, Street and Yumibe tell a new story about how
	a color industry involving film, fashion, print culture,
	architecture, and design changed the look and feel of modern life.
	Street and Yumibe show that, not only were 1920s films often in
	color rather than black and white, but also they were at the heart
	of a set of experiments in color that circulated internationally
	across different media. One of <i>Chromatic Modernity</i>’s greatest
	accomplishments and contributions is its comparative approach. In
	mapping the chromatic culture of the 1920s, it brings together
	artistic, commercial, philosophical, and scientific ventures;
	avant-garde and popular cultural forms; various North American and
	European film industries; as well as multiple mediums and forms of
	cultural production. From accounts of the hybrid processes of
	coloring films to analyses of how color became central to emerging
	aesthetic philosophies and a flash-point in debates about gender,
	race, sensation, and popular culture, the book’s depth and breadth
	attest to Street and Yumibe’s remarkable archival research and deft
	comparative analysis. Street and Yumibe’s exceptional book revises
	our understanding of 1920s film by showing how central color was to
	developments in cinema as well as how cinema was essential to modern
	chromatic culture. </p>

		Archives: The Lifecycles of African American Literature</i> by
	Jean-Christophe Cloutier is an original exploration of the creation,
	silent waiting, and spectral existence of African American writers’
	archival legacies. The author delivers on a great number of levels,
	recounting a suspenseful scholarly story of his excavations within
	archival collections. These led to the discovery in 2009 of Claude
	McKay’s once-lost satirical novel <i>Amiable with Big Teeth</i>
	(written in 1941), which Cloutier then co-edited and published in
	2017 and, later, of the uncatalogued manuscript for Ann Petry’s
		<i>The Street</i> (published in 1946). Cloutier’s description of
	the precarious trajectories of letters, notes, and manuscripts
	through time, in turn, leads to a powerful argument about African
	American authors’ archival sensibilities and their own inherent
	understanding of their fragile legacies. A significant contribution

<p><i>Building Character: The Racial Politics of Modern Architectural

<p>In <i>Left of Poetry: Depression America and the Formation of Modern
		Poetics</i>, Sarah Ehlers asks what makes a political poem: is
	it an inherent quality or is it reader-ordained? Ehlers’s superb
	study responds to this question, leading readers to a set of writers
	for whom poetic and political revolutions were not mutually
	exclusive: pro-Communist Left authors in the Americas working during
	in the 1930s, including Langston Hughes, Muriel Rukeyser, Genevieve
	Taggard, and Jacques Roumain. Moving through these figures’
	employment of documentary and lyric modes, Left of Poetry
	crystallizes how politically engaged poetry surges from the
	immediacy of racial and economic struggle, and a particular
	understanding of the historical. In the exploration of these
	dynamics, Ehlers proposes new directions for historical poetics,
	while shedding light on a body of work consistently ignored by

<p>In his <i>Interwar Modernism and the Liberal World Order</i>, Gabriel

	via its transnational institutions, of an innovative and unsettled
	world order having profound interactions with literary culture.
	Hankins’ judicious historicist and materialist accounts of writings
	by such canonical figures as Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, and W. E.

				Boas </a> (Yale UP, 2018)</em></strong></p>
<p>Franz Boas has received considerable attention from scholars in
	recent decades, so his roles formulating the disciplinary methods of
	anthropology, countering pseudo-scientific racisms, and mentoring a
	highly diverse and influential group of intellectuals are well
	known. However, this extraordinarily well researched volume edited
	and introduced by Blackhawk and Wilner demonstrates that Boas’s work
	accomplished so much, in large part, because it emerged out of a
	remarkably broad assemblage of Indigenous collaborators and because
	it formulated agency rather than passivity regarding the knowledge
	production of colonized and dispossessed peoples. In viewing Boas as
	a globalist thinker through his engagements with Native peoples, the
	contributors to this volume pose ambitious, fresh insights regarding
	the implications of Boas’s work across disciplinary boundaries and
	geographic regions, including Europe, African, and Latin America.
	Far from a celebration of Boas, essays also point to many new lines

<p>Focused on Woolf’s ludic <i>Orlando</i>– the first scholarly

	biography and love-letter to Vita Sackville West—<i>Sentencing
		Orlando</i> ventures into new methodological terrain, taking
	impetus from “the historical and subversive force” ascribed to the
	sentence in Woolf’s work. As Woolf notes in “Craftsmanship,” “Thus
	one sentence of the simplest kind rouses the imagination, the
	memory, the eye, and the ear – all combine in reading it.” The
	volume’s sixteen contributors engage Orlando at the level of the
	sentence, close reading the form and structure of <i>Orlando’s</i>
	“wild” sentences “in the wider context of modernist aesthetics.”
	Each essay takes a single sentence from <i>Orlando</i> as a point of
	departure. The volume’s pathfinding work is undertaken on the
	context of the aesthetic turn in modernist scholarship and what
	Marjorie Levinson calls “activist formalism” – seeking to “reinstate
	close reading both at the curricular center of our discipline” and
	emphasizing the pleasure of the text as a precondition to criticism.
	As the editors note, “<i>Sentencing</i> Orlando makes a case for
	pleasurable, critical explorations in form in modernist fiction that
	begin at the level of the sentence” and “propose(s) a creative model
	not only for research, but also for classroom engagements with
	literature – one that cultivates a slow, deep … immersive reading
	practice that our digital age persistently undermines.” Individual

				>Placeless People: Writing, Rights, and Refugees
			</a></em>(Oxford UP)</strong></p>
<p>Lyndsey Stonebridge’s profound, moving and timely book combines a
	critique of the human rights regime with a reinvestigation of
	literary modernism and modernist humanist thought. With eloquence
	and tenacity, <i>Placeless People</i> reveals how modernist
	assessments and lived experiences of statelessness and rightlessness
	force us to rethink what we mean by the ethics and practice of human
	rights today. Marrying close reading, archival insight, and in-depth
	understanding of the theory and practice of human rights, the book
	tackles one of the most urgent contemporary issues while shedding
	new light on past contexts. Stonebridge leads us patiently through a
	compelling series of mid-twentieth century texts and the experiences
	of or relating to placelessness that informed them: Hannah Arendt’s
	writings on human rights, Kafka’s novels as a form of fiction
	perfectly corresponding to the demise of rights and Brecht’s
	definition of the refugee as a “a messenger of ill tidings”; George
	Orwell’s 1984 as haunted by the ill-fated voyages of refugee boats
	at the beginning and in the aftermath of the Second World War;
	Simone Weil’s political-theological identification with the
	rightless and its legacy in the early 1950s films of Roberto
	Rossellini; Samuel Beckett’s work with the Irish Red Cross and his
	denouncement of facile humanitarianism; Dorothy Richardson’s
	journalistic writing on mass displacement and Thedore A. Morde’s
	1950 documentary <i>Sands of Sorrow</i>; and W. H. Auden’s late
	1930s poems juxtaposed to Yousif M. Qasmiyeh’s poetry of the
	borderline from the 2000s. Constructing deep-time links between
	extraordinary texts created by people in extraordinary circumstances
	and tracing the consistent failure of governments and international
	policy to address the scandal of statelessness and paradoxes of
	citizenship, Stonebridge’s <i>Placeless People</i> demonstrates
	powerfully why impassioned readings of modernist texts and contexts
	continue to matter.</p>

				the Other Half Looks: The Lower East Side and the
				Afterlife of Images </a></em>(Princeton UP)</strong></p>
<p>Sara Blair’s <i>How the Other Half Looks</i> takes on near mythic
	proportions as it recounts, in energetic, sometimes urgent prose,
	the social dynamics and aesthetic experiments that made the Lower
	East Side the iconic American site of alterity. It was here, where
	successive waves of immigrants met and were scrutinized by their
	Other Half, that the dynamic, heterogenous life of modernity,
	bristling with ambition and newfound hope yet rife with poverty,
	vice and crime, was made visible. Blair combines an ethnographer’s
	attention to telling cultural details, a historian’s zealous love
	for unvisited or misunderstood archives and a critic’s alertness to
	the meaning and force of images to convey, often with visceral
	intensity, how the Lower East Side felt as well as looked to the
	artists, photographers, writers and social reformers who were born
	or gravitated there to apprehend, but also to help shape modern
	America. These pages testify to the iconographic power of the Lower
	East Side, the allure it exercised over visual artists, themselves
	iconic, like D. W. Griffith, Paul Strand, Walker Evans, and Ben
	Shawn, and writers like Stephen Crane, Abraham Cahan, Henry Roth,
	Allen Ginsburg, Leroi Jones and Gary Shteyngart intent on capturing
	the roiling life of the newest Americans who had not yet shed their
	past nor made their future. In Blair’s commanding and always subtle
	commentary on the images generated in this quintessential American
	space of encounter, the Lower East Side emerges as a fundamental
	crucible for the forging of American modernity.</p>

				>Learning from Madness: Brazilian Modernism and Global
				Contemporary Art </a></em> (Chicago UP)</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Learning from Madness</i> Kaira M. Cabañas provides an
	inspiring case study of a Brazilian modernism that developed in
	dialogue with the creative work of psychiatric patients. Focusing on
	the work of two psychiatrists—Osório César and Nise da Silveira—who
	created painting studios for their patients from the 1920s to 1960s,
	Cabañas argues that in contrast with similar experiments in Europe,
	in Brazil patients’ works were critiqued as art and, in fact, played
	an integral role in defining aesthetic modernism. Such art produced
	in and around psychiatric institutions resonates still in Brazilian
	popular culture today and has played a role in introducing a
	distinctive Brazilian modernism as a global modernism on the
	contemporary global art exhibition circuit. The latter sections of
	the book shift attention to how such art is curated in exhibitions
	and the politics of doing so. A blend of art history, transnational
	art theory and curatorial studies, this book by Cabañas works to
	undo some persistent modernist myths about authorship, creativity,
	the status of art and the legibility of the global through what she
	terms the “common creativity” of psychiatric patients and the
	critics and curators who engage with their work. This is a must-read
	for anyone trying to think through the complexities of curating and
	narrating a doubly-marginalised art practice as a form of global
	modernism. Cabañas carries out her study with nuance and delicacy,
	and raises a challenging set of questions that will inspire future

		UP)</strong></p>
<p>Martino Stierli’s <i>Montage and the Metropolis</i> is a landmark
	contribution to our understanding of relationship between the
	development and representation of urban space and the category and
	practice of montage. Engaging history and theory of architecture,
	photography, film, literature, historiography, and popular visual
	culture since the late nineteenth century, Stierli’s thoroughly
	researched and beautifully illustrated book reassesses the category
	of montage as not only a dominant modernist compositional principle
	but also a way to think about embodied moving through space more
	generally—a key strategy for the production of meaning, adopted by
	multiple constituencies. With its wide international scope and
	inspiring attention to detail, Montage and the Metropolis
	continuously surprises the reader. It segues from photomontage (in
	range from early photography to dadaists, futurists, and Soviet
	constructivists), through film theory of Sergei Eisenstein, Mies van
	der Rohe’s spatial experiments, to Rem Koolhaas’s use of literary
	montage, while engaging a further cohort of artists, writers,

	from and shapes our new ways of seeing, cognizing, and experiencing

<p>In the stunning <i>Designs of Destruction: The Making of Monuments in

	with breath-taking—but wholly realized—ambition, provides a
	fascinating and path-breaking approach to global architectural

	period, to the seismic shock of WWII, and culminating in a
	revelatory discussion of the Temple of Abu Simbel in 1968. This is a

	inheritance that pervade modernist studies: as readers, we turn and
	‘chase the dead’; they chase us in turn. <i>Out of Context</i> is an
	imaginative and idiosyncratic recasting of modernist literary
	history from the perspective of the reader and critic, throwing open
	the questions of what we do at all when we formulate such histories,
	and examining the idea of the trans-historical with fresh vigor and

<p>With a wonderfully lucid style, <i>Hieroglyphic Modernisms</i>
	deciphers the hieroglyphs at the heart of literary, cinematic, and
	digital modernism. Schotter argues that modernist theories of media
	depended on the Egyptian hieroglyph to explain the affordances of

	ones, such as print. Hieroglyphs, even when mystified and
	misinterpreted as a purely pictorial language, enabled

	the hybrid nature of writing. Schotter’s superb readings of Vachel
	Lindsay, Sergei Eisenstein, Virginia Woolf, Joseph Conrad, James
	Joyce, Thomas Pynchon, Ishmael Reed, and others show how the
	perceived visuality of the hieroglyph shaped modernist conceptions
	of literary character, narrative form, cinematic style, and postwar
	computing. Yet, what makes this work truly stand out is Schotter’s
	refusal to stop at generative Western misconceptions of non-Western
	writing systems; instead, he brings the hieroglyph back to Egypt
	with analyses of early novels by Naguib Mahfouz and Tawfiq al-Hakim
	and the 1923 Egyptian film, <i>In the Land of Tutankhamen</i>, to

<p>Shifting our attention from a poetics of shock to a more temporally
	capacious understanding of surprise, Kate Stanley’s ambitious study
	asks us to rethink several of the core assumptions underwriting
	nearly all accounts of modernist aesthetics. <i>Practices of
		Surprise</i> offers a fresh perspective on the paradoxically
	shopworn belief that modernism is defined by the ambition to make it
	new, suggesting on the contrary that the crucial goal for an
	important strain of literary modernists was the more challenging
	project of making it new <i>again</i>: how to teach their readers to
	prepare themselves to continue to be surprised by their texts and by
	the world. Rather than halting time or spatializing the temporal,
	Stanley illuminates the many ways that literature might stitch
	moments of aesthetic perception into the lived experience of their
	readers in temporally complex ways. Stanley traces a revealing
	genealogy of pragmatic modernism, highlighting a line of influence
	running through Emerson to Baudelaire and Proust and back to the
	American modernism of Henry James, Gertrude Stein, Nella Larsen, and
	John Cage. An important work of affect theory as well as a
	compelling example of pragmatist pedagogy, Stanley’s book lives up

				Postcolonial Poetry </a></em> (Harvard University
		Press)</strong></p>
<p>This major publication gives new and global life to decadence. Robert
	Stilling argues that aestheticism and literary decadence, movements
	deeply associated with the decline of European empires, provided a
	rich source of inspiration for postcolonial writers and artists
	ranging from Agha Shahid Ali, Derek Walcott, and Wole Soyinka to
	Yinka Shonibare, Bernardine Evaristo, and Derek Mahon. What
	initiates this colloquy is the shared conviction that only a
	decadent poetics could capture the historical sensation of
	“beginning at the end.” Stilling beautifully describes how decadence
	allowed these figures to mediate between the desire for an
	autonomous individualism and the demands of burgeoning cultural
	nationalisms, which saw collective futures arising out of Europe’s
	fall. Individual chapters inventively pair fin-de-siècle and
	postcolonial writers, and offer masterful co-elaborations of
	artifice and beauty in the contexts of globalized industrialization
	and underdevelopment. By moving across Oscar Wilde and Ali, J.K.
	Huysmans and Evaristo, Henry James and Mahon, Stilling shows readers
	how a comparative and transnational approach to modernism can
	challenge the usual before-and-after of literary history and the
	critical shorthand we use to distinguish periods and styles from one
	another. This is a deeply learned and original work that shows the
	necessity of bringing modernist and postcolonial studies
	together.</p>

		(Northwestern University Press)</strong></p>
<p>In this outstanding book, Sarah J. Townsend uncovers a series of
	fascinating stories from the early twentieth century histories of
	the Mexican and Brazilian avant-gardes, stories centered on
	impossible performances and events that never happened. Rather than
	cast the incomplete and unrealized visions of the artists and
	intellectuals it describes as failures, <i>The Unfinished Art of
		Theater</i> suggests instead that their unfinishedness provides
	an important opportunity to reconsider the association of the
	avant-garde with performative immediacy. The institutional weakness
	of theater in Mexico and Brazil, two countries on the semi-periphery
	of global capital, make it emblematic rather than exceptional of the
	temporal complexities of modernity. Townsend complicates standard
	theories of the avant-garde that associate it with rupture and
	refusal, underscoring instead the imbrication of vanguard aesthetics
	with experiences of dependency, belatedness, and the many
	contradictions generated by the uneven development of capitalism.
	Drawing on an impressive range of archival evidence and written with
	a rare combination of storytelling and theoretical savvy, Townsend’s

<p>Two decades after the founding of the Modernist Journals Project, the

	procedures of media studies and world literature, two fields that

	little magazine to have been as globally consequential as that of
		<i>modernism</i>, as it has been heretofore understood. Bulson
	honors the familiar story of the little magazine as the engine of
	international modernism, while also emphasizing equally critical
	instances of magazines’ failure to circulate, their exile,
	immobility, untranslatability, postcolonial failures or refusals of

				>Poet-Critics and the Administration of Culture
			</a></em>(Harvard)</strong></p>
<p>The expectation that poets should also write criticism is an idea
	that has become almost as naturalized as the association of poets
	with the culture and curriculum of the university. With a keen eye
	on the years between the Great Depression and the early postwar
	period, however, Evan Kindley’s <i>Poet-Critics and the
		Administration of Culture</i> returns us to a world where the
	university was only one of several possible refuges for poetic
	culture. During this period of radical cultural instability,
	poet-critics sought means of supporting their own and others’ poetic
	work, and forms of protection from an indifferent marketplace. As
	Kindley reveals, this relief was discovered not only in
	universities, but across a range of midcentury institutions, most
	notably government agencies and philanthropic foundations. The price
	of gaining such partial autonomy was to become an advocate for the
	liberal state, and subject to it. But it was also, as Kindley shows,
	often viewed as an opportunity, not only to secure a durable
	location for modernism, but one in which the poet-critic could be
	socially authorized as an expert arbiter of culture. A surprising
	but revealing emblem of this argument is the fact that so much of
	this institutional story should be imprinted in the poets’ verse.
	Alongside genuine archival discoveries, Kindley’s readings of Eliot,
	Auden, Marianne Moore, Sterling Brown, Archibald MacLeish and others
	provide us with new understanding of those poets and the sometimes
	very large claims they were willing to make on behalf of verse
	culture. Genially written but incisive in its analysis,
		<i>Poet-Critics and the Administration of Culture</i> is a model
	of economy and style. Kindley shows how these poet-critics were the
	architects of the world we now inhabit, albeit in a situation of far
	greater precarity. This book is essential reading for anyone
	interested in why and how we might defend this tenuous arrangement
	today.</p>

				>Tastemaker: Elizabeth Gordon, House Beautiful, and the
				Postwar American Home </a></em> (Yale)</strong></p>
<p>When we think of postwar American architecture and the modernist
	aesthetics that it bequeaths, we think of Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter
	Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Philip Johnson, and other famous men. Few
	people would think of Elizabeth Gordon, editor-in-chief of the
	popular consumer magazine <i>House Beautiful</i>. But Monica
	Penick's monograph <i>Tastemaker: Elizabeth Gordon, House Beautiful,
		and the Postwar American Home</i> is about to change this.
	Simultaneously a rich history and an incisive analysis, this book
	gives us an engrossing account of how Gordon, through her magazine,
	shaped --indeed, made de rigueur -- some of the fundamental
	questions we ask today when it comes to our living environment: what
	is a "good design"; why that is of value; and what constitutes
	"better living." Indeed, Gordon may be the precursor to what we
	today call an "influencer," except her agenda is far from trivial.
	Preoccupied with issues of design as an ethics of the quotidian,
	with the challenges of the climate control and American regionalism,
	Gordon used her magazine <i>House Beautiful</i> as a vehicle to
	promulgate her philosophic and intellectual ideas. And, as Penick so
	beautifully documents, Gordon's editorial programs reshaped ideas
	about American living, and, by extension, what consumers bought,
	what designers, made and what manufacturers brought to market. This
	implicitly feminist treatise also reminds us that, when it comes to
	understanding modernist architecture, design, and taste (which is to
	say, value), we would do well to turn our attention beyond the usual
	sources (for example, professional and often predominantly masculine
	architectural journals) to the presumably domestic and more
	peripheral site of a “woman’s magazine.” Elegantly written, full of
	unexpected archival details and gorgeous photographs of mid-century
	architecture and design, this book reinvents the archive of
	modernist aesthetics.</p>

				>The Black Skyscraper: Architecture and the Perception
				of Race </a></em> (Johns Hopkins UP, 2017)</strong></p>
<p>How did modern architecture mediate the lived experience of race?
	Bringing together the cross-cutting histories of Reconstruction,
	late nineteenth-century immigration into the United States, and the
	dawn of the Jim Crow era, Adrienne Brown’s <i>The Black Skyscraper:
		Architecture and the Perception of Race</i> invites us to look
	at tall buildings from a dazzling new perspective. In the years
	between the skyscraper’s invention in the 1880s and the unveiling of
	the Empire State Building in 1931, Brown argues, denizens of
	American cities entered into a new “racial sensorium,” a
	phenomenological condition characterized by the disorienting,
	seemingly anti-gravitational proliferation of taller and taller
	buildings. <i>The Black Skyscraper</i> revisits canonical works by
	Howells, James, Larsen, Fitzgerald, and DuBois to uncover a powerful
	relationship between race and architectural form that determines the
	modern individual’s racially coded place (or placelessness) within
	metropolitan social hierarchies. And the skyscraper’s complex
	visuality not only influenced the aesthetics of realist fiction and
	flights of modernist experimentation, but also contributed to the
	stylistic and generic variety of popular Jazz Age and Harlem
	Renaissance forms: pulp, melodrama, and science fiction. Brown’s
	study marries rich archival and historical research with close
	readings of literary texts, revealing how the skyscraper’s scale,
	and the shadows it cast, produced crucial – and until now overlooked
	– racial dimensions of American modernism.</p>

				>Cultivation and Catastrophe: The Lyric Ecology of Black
				Literature </a></em>(Johns Hopkins UP,
	2017)</strong></p>
<p>Impressive in both scope and depth, Sonya Posmentier’s <i>Cultivation
		and Catastrophe: The Lyric Ecology of Black Literature</i> opens
	new horizons for ecocritical study of Black literature, particularly
	experimental twentieth-century poetry. Every chapter offers
	trenchant insight into Black writers’ engagement with “haunted
	ecologies,” while also raising acute questions about eco-critical
	methodologies in relation to Black diasporic aesthetics and
	(inter)nationalism as well as Black pessimism, optimism, and
	temporality. In rendering the bodily and communal experience of
	“catastrophic rupture” within ruinous landscapes, Black lyric
	poetry, Posmentier argues, also cultivates a futurity and continuity
	that ultimately “reorients the temporality of Black history.” She
	builds a sense of this temporal reorienting across several
	generations in her exquisite poetic readings of lyric poets and
	singers ranging from Claude McKay, Sterling Brown, and Bessie Smith
	to Gwendolyn Brooks, Derek Walcott and M. NourbeSe Philip. At the
	same time, Posmentier’s remixed formulations about the sonic, the
	textual, the bodily, and the environmental reverberate across
	genres—as she indicates in her reading of lyrics in Zora Neale
	Hurston’s fiction. In this way, Sonya Posmentier’s breathtaking
	study sheds light on several genres of Black literature, and indeed
	on the bio-political work of many literatures. </p>

		alt="" width="100" height="150" align="right" />An astute,
	impish bricoleur’s voice enlivens <i>Soviet Salvage: Imperial
		Debris, Revolutionary Reuse, and Russian Constructivism</i>—as
	is fitting for this creative, interdisciplinary study of
	Constructivism’s aesthetic-functionalist practices after the 1917
	Russian Revolution. Catherine Walworth’s own bricoleur method issues
	in a startling reframing of the “modernist” early phase Russian
	Communist art. Amid postrevolutionary shortages of essential goods
	in Russia, Walworth first of all points out, reuse and recycling
	were part of “a pervasive reality.” Everything from tea cups to
	buildings were caught up in this retooling, yielding ironic fusions
	of the imperial and the revolutionary. Thus the Bolsheviks
	administered their revolution from the lavishly furnished rooms of
	the imperial Winter Place, which also held a workshop where artists
	reimagined principles of design and refashioned luxury objects into
	functional ones. There the often hungry, cold artmakers themselves
	depended on “retoolings,” cutting up expensive carpets to create
	warm boots. Keeping her own readers grounded in these material
	realities, Walworth makes visceral the ways in which this
	combination of material scarcity and revolutionary reoccupation of
	the habitus gave birth to Constructivism’s signature
	features—splicings of styles and spatial planes, and streamlining of
	form and function. Walworth’s visually stimulating and expertly
	written study deserves a wide readership among historians, political
	theorists, and literary and visual arts scholars. For by focusing on
	the ways that Russian artists gave new form to the “debris” of
	empire, Walworth offers far-reaching insights into the ways that art
	undergirds the political economy of states—and their historical
	remaking. </p>

<p>The role of radio’s “narrative acoustics” in in reshaping social
	relations across the Americas is the subject of this superb study,
	which combines rigorously revisionist media history with visionary
	conceptual power to tell the fascinating story of radio’s narrative
	revolutions. Radio’s forms of mediation gave its narratives and
	those it inspired new perspectives, new temporalities, and new maps
	for public connections. The results, discovered there through
	extensive work with diverse archival materials, changed everything
	from ways of listening to ideas of property ownership. New
	techniques of mediation prompted John Dos Passos to shape his
	fiction as a response to New Deal acoustics. Radio helped Raymond
	Chandler and Carson McCullers developed new media forms for
	property-rights advocacy. Radio’s popular acoustics gave Richard
	Wright new ways to conceive of black voice and shared speech. Its
	effects upon listening and imitation prompted Manuel Puig to
	transform the very idea of authorship, and its <i>radionovelas</i>
	became a forum for promoting the Good Neighbor Policy in Cuba. These
	and other ingenious ways of reading radio’s narrative techniques
	make <i>Acoustic Properties</i> a dazzling contribution to media

<p>Morehead’s ingenious work shifts the very foundations of modernist
	visual culture through nothing less than a redefinition of modernist
	symbolism, which now emerges as product of the
	late-nineteenth-century epistemology of experiment. This boldly
	revisionist idea involves another foundational aspect of modernism:
	experimentalism itself, which here means a method grounded in
	nature’s own experiments, the often bizarre phenomena and
	pathological alterities through which nature reveals itself.
	Explaining how a set of central symbolist artists went from such
	naturalist revelations to symbolist forms, Morehead develops a
	fascinating account of a cultural formation without which we would
	not have the forms of avant-gardism that define modernism—that have
	defined it without recognizing the debt of radical experiment to the
	pathological method that actually inspired the deformities of
	Maurice Denis, the arabesques of Édouard Vuillard, and the
	methodical madness of Edvard Munch. Not only is the meaning of
	experimental modernism at stake in this brilliant argument, but also
	our idea of what modernism makes of <i>otherness</i>. Arguing for a
	new way to understand the use of alterity to modernist forms,
	Morehead discovers the ethics as well as the aesthetics of
	symbolism’s secret naturalism.</p>

				Modernism: Photography, Writing and Space in Shanghai,
				1925-1937</a></em> (Duke UP, 2017).</strong></p>
<p><i>Shadow Modernism</i> brings a welcome historical and theoretical
	dynamism to modernism’s international currents. Schaefer eschews
	longstanding East/West dichotomies to explain how Shanghai’s dense
	fields of cultural production in the early 20th century contributed
	to and reflected global modernist forms. This carefully written
	study – which focuses on Chinese literary texts as well as
	photography, cartoons, landscape painting, and avant-garde and
	popular magazine layout – documents the emergence of art-forms
	marked by historical self-consciousness and the desire to capture
	the fractured, abstract, and dissociative qualities of Shanghai’s
	urban modernity. <i>Shadow Modernism</i> secures a place for
	Shanghai’s artists in the canons and archives of modernism through
	its detailed, beautifully illustrated presentation of figures such
	as the critic Fu Lei, the editor and fiction writer Shi Zecun, and
	the magazines <i>Xiandai</i> (“Les contemporains”) and <i>Wenyi

	demonstrates, with its new techniques for mediating reality, is the

	comprehensive, imaginative in its range, scrupulously scholarly, and
	the two volumes close with a full textual history of the poems.
		<i>The Waste Land</i> alone has a 62-page commentary – which
	will change the way we read this key epochal text – and 56 pages of

<p>Despite being distinct in terms of politics and aesthetics, W. B.
	Yeats, Louis MacNeice, Elizabeth Bowen and Samuel Beckett are bound
	together by their extensive engagement with the radio medium. In
		<i>The Wireless Past</i>, Emily Bloom examines how modern
	literature came to be shaped by this new medium, for which writers
	were encouraged to use interior monologues, first-person narration
	and an intimate mode of address. But Yeats, MacNeice, Bowen and
	Beckett also developed distinctive techniques for conceptualizing
	radio publics, as Bloom shows in each chapter. Yeats’s radio poetry
	evoked traditional spaces for oral poetry such as the Greek stage
	and then showed the impossibility of these spaces for modern
	poetics. MacNeice’s poetry and radio scripts highlighted the
	complexities of communication in wartime, as radio came to be used
	as a powerful propaganda tool but also as a way to connect people
	isolated by travel restrictions. <i>The Wireless Past</i> makes a
	significant contribution to the field of “radio modernism” – a field
	that has grown rapidly as a major research trend in modernist

	delivers a genealogy of 19th- and early-20th-century media

	varying material supports, technologies, and effects on the
	perception of bodies and space. Without an understanding of
	darkness, Elcott shows, we miss much of what is most modern about
	the cinema of Georges Méliès and the avant-garde productions of
	Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer. Elcott’s “media archeology” not only
	reveals an intermedial <i>dispositif</i> of artificial darkness

				>Surrealism in Egypt: Modernism and the Art and Liberty
				Group </a></em>(I.B. Taurus, 2016)</strong></p>
<p><i>Surrealism in Egypt</i> historically and critically recuperates
	the Art and Liberty surrealist group in World War II Egypt. While
	recovering this late modernist network, it leverages the
	contingencies and exigencies of the group to question deep set
	assumptions about center and periphery as well as the critical
	habits that assume totalizing narratives of imperialism and
	Orientalism. This approach buttresses and challenges narratives of
	decolonization and their inherently Eurocentric focus on imperial
	power – it instead asks how Egyptian Surrealism extended outward and
	demanded global changes. Bardaouil establishes the enormous scope of
	the Art and Liberty movement, reaching from Spain to Syria and Cairo
	to Paris, but also and most effectively recovers long neglected
	original art and archives. The ready movement between primary
	materials in Arabic, French, and English brings this cosmopolitan
	group into coherence and demands attention from the wider study of
	late modernism. The “exhibition” pattern, or comparatist approach,
	is skilfully handled and made accessible to readers from different
	disciplines. With its attachment to the <i>Art et Liberté: Rupture,
		War and Surrealism in Egypt (1938–1948)</i> exhibition,
		<i>Surrealism in Egypt</i> is a polemical yet persuasively

<p><i>Modern Print Artefacts</i> delivers a rich rethinking of the

	In its conclusions, it offers a disciplinary reach across the field
	to ask how such discussions are limited or relegated to peripheral
	disciplinary venues. The polemic is demanding for modernist studies
	and urgently calls for both scholarly and professional soul
	searching, while at the same time the archival and critical

<p><i>Attention Equals Life</i> is the culmination of work from the past

	for broad audiences and makes a compelling extension of discussions

<p><i>Learning to Kneel</i> delivers an enticingly original approach to

<p><i>Fiery Cinema</i> tracks the emergence of a particular set of
	discourses around and practices in Chinese cinema in the period
	1915-45. In this context, it argues, cinema is understood to be an
	affective medium, which means not only that it solicits an immediate

	and historical locatedness – from the early martial arts films of

<p><i>F.B. Eyes</i> is an extraordinarily rich account of FBI
	surveillance of African American modernists from the origins of the
	FBI to the 1970s. It is striking not only for its account of the
	reach and extent of this surveillance but also for its links to the

	shows how the FBI’s study of African American writers was tightly

	the FBI as perhaps the most dedicated and influential forgotten

		(Cambridge University Press, 2015)</strong></p>
<p><i>Modernism and the Reinvention of Decadence</i> challenges

<p>With great theoretical and philosophical virtuosity, C. D. Blanton
	recalibrates the interpretive and historical possibilities of late
	modernist poetics. <i>Epic Negation</i> convincingly reconsiders
	British literature in the 1930s, a period regularly understood to
	mark the retreat of the “Auden generation” (including Stephen
	Spender, Louis MacNeice, Cecil Day-Lewis, and William Empson) from
	the precedents and commitments of such outsized precursors as T. S.
	Eliot and Ezra Pound. Developing an ambitious conceptual matrix,
	Blanton understands their writings not as diminished echoes of a
	prior generation’s monumental innovations, but as tactical responses
	to perceptions of crisis, locally and globally. Epic Negation
	thereby confronts and corrects a conventional story of modernism’s
	decline or dissipation toward mid-century, arguing that more
	lyrically self-contained works both sustain and radically intensify
	Pound’s own “epic” injunction to make poems that “include history.”
	In Blanton’s account, late modernism is therefore still epic
	modernism, though by other means – embracing poetic practices
	“attenuated and dislocated, in a crucial sense disarticulated, by
	the very history” they must incorporate.</p>

<p>In <i>The Ethnic Avant-Garde</i>, Steven S. Lee considers a moment in

	were not incompatible and do not <i>by necessity</i> have to be. The
	book retells a story of the famously fraught relationship between
	the two internationals (the vanguard and the avant-garde) through
	their engagement with racial and colonial oppression. In so doing,
	Lee moves athwart the perspectives of Marxist scholarship and

<p><i>Insurgent Testimonies</i> challenges the temporal and territorial

	methodological vocabulary that synthesizes incisive close readings

	damage, Nicole Rizzuto traces how testimony to the traumas of
	British imperial violence was secreted into modernist insurgent
	writing. The book ranges agilely across genres, moving beyond

<p><i>When the Future Disappears</i> is both a remarkable work of
	literary history and a groundbreaking meditation on modernisms
	across temporal and political regimes and transnational contexts.
	Poole accounts with striking range and fluency for the complex field
	of literary production in Korea during the final decade of its
	colonial occupation by Japan. In that fraught moment, she argues, a
	distinctive but broadly consequential modernism took shape. Faced
	with the colonial suppression of their native language and state
	control of publication and literary institutions, Korean writers
	were compelled to represent the loss of their language, their past,
	and their sense of the future, mobilizing modes of irony, paradox,
	abstraction, and silence to represent the lived experience of being
	and becoming modern as colonial subjects of Japan. Even for readers
	with no knowledge of Korean language or literature, Poole’s readings
	of key texts and figures makes a richly detailed case that Korea’s
	literary project, taking shape in the moment of global fascism,
	offers some of the most ambitious and provocative works of
	twentieth-century modernism across the globe. Her analysis not only
	creates a powerful framework for constituting Korean modernism as
	such. It repeatedly moves through Anglo-European modernism, and
	takes on the broader problem of accounting for temporal rupture,
	state violence, and the experience of colonization as generative
	conditions of cultural production. Deftly braiding literary history
	and textual readings with cultural and intellectual history, Poole
	has produced a work that models new, bracing possibilities for
	global and transnational modernist study, and for bold rethinking of
	the paradigms that shape our account of the relationship between
	aesthetic and political forms.</p>

			</a></em> (Oxford)</strong></p>
<p>In a richly historical, impeccably researched analysis of suffrage
	literature, Mary Chapman argues both that the 19th amendment was
	ratified because women in the U.S. developed an innovative and
	forceful print culture to advocate their views and that this print
	culture had a direct impact on modernist literary forms. The volume
	begins with an eye-opening detailed chronology of the American
	Women’s Suffrage Campaign, beginning in 1777, as women begin losing
	the vote in various states, and continuing through 1965; it
	concludes with a coda titled “Genealogies of Modernism and Suffrage:
		<i>The Mother[s] of Us All</i>” on Gertrude Stein’s “cubist
	chronologies.” Between these points, it ranges broadly through
	journalism, fiction, and poetry written in direct relation to the
	suffrage movement and its issues. Chapman’s study uncovers
	previously unknown publications by Marianne Moore and Sui Sin Far
	and analyses them in relation to better known aspects of these
	writers’ careers (for example, Moore’s collaged quoting practice),
	thereby also illuminating the politics of these, and other, writers

		alt="" width="100" height="150" align="right" /><i>When the
		Future Disappears</i> is both a remarkable work of literary
	history and a groundbreaking meditation on modernisms across
	temporal and political regimes and transnational contexts. Poole
	accounts with striking range and fluency for the complex field of
	literary production in Korea during the final decade of its colonial
	occupation by Japan. In that fraught moment, she argues, a
	distinctive but broadly consequential modernism took shape. Faced
	with the colonial suppression of their native language and state
	control of publication and literary institutions, Korean writers
	were compelled to represent the loss of their language, their past,
	and their sense of the future, mobilizing modes of irony, paradox,
	abstraction, and silence to represent the lived experience of being
	and becoming modern as colonial subjects of Japan. Even for readers
	with no knowledge of Korean language or literature, Poole’s readings
	of key texts and figures makes a richly detailed case that Korea’s
	literary project, taking shape in the moment of global fascism,
	offers some of the most ambitious and provocative works of
	twentieth-century modernism across the globe. Her analysis not only
	creates a powerful framework for constituting Korean modernism as
	such. It repeatedly moves through Anglo-European modernism, and
	takes on the broader problem of accounting for temporal rupture,
	state violence, and the experience of colonization as generative
	conditions of cultural production. Deftly braiding literary history
	and textual readings with cultural and intellectual history, Poole
	has produced a work that models new, bracing possibilities for
	global and transnational modernist study, and for bold rethinking of
	the paradigms that shape our account of the relationship between
	aesthetic and political forms. </p>

				>Killing the Moonlight: Modernism in Venice </a></em>
		(Columbia)</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Killing the Moonlight</i>, Jennifer Scappettone performs a
	scholarly quarry of a city fabled in the literary history and
	cultural memory of Europe. Excavating the social geology of the
	Venetian site, surveying the layers of archaeological as well as
	architectural and artistic accumulation, Scappettone’s research
	opens the manifold dimensions of this legacy as a kind of living
	museum of European dreams. Critically, in a series of focused and
	revealing readings of its cultural locations, she also demonstrates
	a long history of such readings: in a process equally self-reflexive
	and illuminating, she shows how powerfully Venice speaks to the
	desires of political visionaries and aesthetic revolutionaries
	alike. A city ever sinking into the sea but always also renewing
	itself out of its museums of human history: the Venice of this
	compelling account presents those opposite possibilities as the
	substance of a major, generative tension in the imaginative
	consciousness of modernity. Venice extends its appeal in this
	convincing analysis to an English-language modernist imagination in
	particular, which finds in the history and memory of the city a
	representative, even exemplary, demonstration: art may be “made
	new,” after all, only once it is “already old,” and this double
	measure runs as a delineating rhythm in the history of the city
	Scappettone reclaims so engagingly and persuasively.</p>

<p>In a thoroughly researched and wide-ranging analysis, Anna Snaith
	extends ongoing discussions of colonialism, national identity, and
	gender in analyzing the work of women writers who subvert the logic
	of imperialism through their transgressive mobility—traveling from
	the imperial periphery of the colonies where they spent their
	formative years to its metropolitan center, London. Snaith moves
	persuasively through critical canons, theoretical discourse on
	transnationalism, colonial modernism, feminism, and modernist
	studies, to fine close readings of a number of authors—both
	relatively canonical (Olive Schreiner, Jean Rhys, Katherine
	Mansfield) and less well-known (Una Marson, Sarojini Naidu, Sara
	Jeannette Duncan, Christina Stead). These writers, she demonstrates,
	combine a focus on urbanism, capitalism, and colonialism in ways
	both demonstrating that formal literary experimentation is in part a
	product of imperial ideology and anti-colonialism and more generally
	redrawing lines of relationship between politics and aesthetics. For
	these women and other writers, London served as a catalyst for
	feminist anti-colonialism. By writing transgressively feminist
	fiction to reimagine imperial structures, these colonial writers
	helped to destabilize imperial ideology in their homelands and
	throughout the empire. Snaith gives us texts and tools to understand
	relationships between literary modernism, feminism,
	transnationalism, and postcolonial studies in new ways.</p>

				href="http://fordhampress.com/the-poitics-of-irony-in-american-modernism-cloth.html"
				>The Politics of Irony in American Modernism</a></em>
		(Fordham)</strong></p>
<p>In <i>The Politics of Irony in American Modernism</i>, Matthew
	Stratton offers a history of attitudes and practices of “irony” in
	modernist texts and, in the process, provides an anatomy of its
	imaginative as well as critical functions. The major claim, which is
	sustained across a range of engaging and persuasive analyses of
	writings either explicitly or implicitly political, is that irony
	serves to dislodge the consciousness of its reader from the
	positions of an existing politics, whether these are already taken
	or unreflectively assumed; thus irony reorients the mind to a
	novelty of possibility that is quintessentially modernist.
	Trans-historical as well as transatlantic in its range of reference,
	this study moves fluently through Nietzsche to Ellison, from John
	Dos Passos to New Criticism, tracing genealogical outlines of its
	evolving concepts and taking in gendered dimensions of understanding
	as well. The result is a transformational history of American
	literary modernism, where the sensibility implemented in irony moves
	forcefully forward from the position of retreat into which it has
	been pushed by earlier, presumptive understandings: it reclaims its
	role now as an active, not a reactive, instrument of reimagining
	political history. In lucid and insightful prose, in a writing style
	animated when appropriate by the spirit of wit in its subject,
	Stratton tells the history of his subject in a work of model
	scholarship. </p>

	supposed to read this difficult modernist without a proper
	companion, a biography that might help make sense of her
	idiosyncratic poetics. It is as if the lenses had never been

	the winner of the 2013 Modernist Studies Association book prize.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Collecting as Modernist Practice</strong></em> is an
	elegantly written, thoughtfully argued, and captivating book. It
	places collecting at the center of modernist practice so
	convincingly that, as its account unfolds, it seems virtually
	self-evident that collectors such as Albert Barnes, editors such as
	Alfred Kreymborg, and patrons including John Quinn were crucial
	architects of modernism in all of its complexities. </p>
<p>The research for the book is admirably rigorous; one can sense
	throughout that Braddock carefully and thoroughly parsed the
	archives, collections, and anthologies about which he theorizes to
	generate his claims. He lays out his argument with such lucidity
	that the book serves as an enviable example of compellingly readable
	academic scholarship. </p>
<p>The book sheds valuable light onto issues related to
	transnationalism, materialism, race, and sexuality, demonstrating
	how these concepts inform the collecting practices that shaped
	modernism. <em><strong>Collecting as Modernist
		Practice</strong></em> is the first book published in the new
	Hopkins Studies in Modernism Series, and it signals a series off to

	and literary affiliations around the globe. For
	GoGwilt,&nbsp;moreover, &quot;literary and artistic modernism
	properly belongs within a history of
	decolonization.&quot;&nbsp;Rethinking the philological principles of
	such scholars as Erich Auerbach, Edward Said, and Raymond Williams,
	GoGwilt details a &quot;post-colonial philology&quot; that can
	better describe the imperatives shaping literary studies in the
	aftermath of decolonization. His extensive&nbsp;attention to
	language and text gives real heft to prior, more abstract efforts to
	see modernism in a &quot;planetary&quot;
	configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is an exemplary model for both
	classic and transnational modernist studies. </p>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Anne Cheng's <em>Second Skin: Josephine Baker and the Modern
			Surface</em> (Oxford UP)</strong><br /> The book is
	impeccably blurbed by such notable scholars as Brent Edwards, Kobena
	Mercer, and Kaja Silverman, who collectively suggest that Cheng is
	the new Fanon with her highly original account of race. With its
	iconic image of Baker overlaid with the emblematic skyscraper, that
	cover is indisputably modernist. And Cheng's prose is as seductive
	as its cover. Discussing painting, architecture, burlesque,
	striptease, and film, Cheng demonstrates how common understandings
	of certain aesthetic principles transferred themselves across
	disparate sites of aesthetic production, from Adolf Loos'
	architectural focus on surfaces to the much broader focus on
	Josephine Baker's skin itself. In Cheng's analysis, the phenomenon
	of Baker <em>is</em> modernism, with its &quot;entwined crises of
	race, style, and subjecthood&quot; (4). The fascination with
	surfaces and the generalized atmosphere of formalist aesthetics to
	which it testifies finds a fertile critical imagination here and
	expands not only what we know about modernism but how we can now
	think about it as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ruth Hoberman's <em>Museum Trouble: Edwardian Fiction and the
			Emergence of Modernism</em> (U of Virginia Press)
	</strong><br /> Hoberman develops a fascinating rereading of the
	emergence of&nbsp;Anglo-American modernism in the complex, yet
	deeply embedded context of its relations to museum knowledge and
	culture. Hoberman provides an excellent cultural historical approach
	to the contexts for modernist aesthetic production by anchoring
	arguments about taste and the relationship between aesthetic
	appreciation and morality in a demonstrable institutional history.
	The potential for this book to enhance current approaches to
	modernist material culture, directly through objects themselves, is
	remarkable and points towards an area of scholarship that has yet to
	achieve its full impact in modernist studies.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Andrew Jones's <em>Developmental Fairy Tales: Evolutionary
			Thinking and Modern Chinese Culture</em> (Harvard U P)
	</strong><br /> This book is a pathbreaking&nbsp;discussion of the
	emergence of Chinese modernism from Anglo-turn-of-the-century models
	of social development.&nbsp; As thoroughly in command of the
	current, most compelling&nbsp;thinking on modernism as it is on late
	Victorian texts, this book is likely to become one of the leading
	studies of modernism as a global phenomenon. <em>Developmental Fairy
		Tales </em>accomplishes several difficult tasks at once: it
	introduces new readers to Chinese modernist writing, establishes the
	intellectual context in which it emerged, and makes a strong
	critical argument about the role played by theories of childhood and
	the didactic text in the advent of modernist aesthetics. This book
	is sure to become an important point of reference for scholars
	interested in the trans-cultural movement of modernist ideas and in
	particular the development of modernism in non-Western contexts. </p>
<p><strong>Annalisa Zox-Weaver. Zox-Weaver's <em>Women Modernists and
			Fascism</em> (Cambridge UP) </strong><br />
	<em>Women Modernists</em> is a sophisticated, eye-opening, and
	unique work dealing with a number of currently highly visible issues
	in modernist studies. This excellent interdisciplinary study
	recovers the&nbsp;fascinating and critical role played by public
	women intellectuals and artists in imagining and documenting Hitler,
	from Gertrude Stein and documentary filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl and
	to journalist Janet Flanner and photographer Lee Miller, while
	simultaneously tracking the Nazi leader's rise and fall.&nbsp;
	Forging an unexpected link between apparently disparate
	constituencies -- women writers and fascism – and disparate genres,
	Zox-Weaver contributes to the reassessment of fascism's truly
	central place in Anglo-American modernism. Her readings, drawing on
	substantial archival materials, are illuminating, and her overall
	approach a refreshing re-take on the relationship between modernism
	and fascism that has, at times, threatened to become a caricature,
	bringing the caricature back into the realm of life, and restores
	much of its complexity and ambiguity.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>2011 MSA Book Prize</h2>
<p>The Modernist Studies Association awards its 2011 Book Prize to
		<strong>Michael Rubenstein's</strong>, <strong><a
			href="http://undpress.nd.edu/book/P01391"><em>Public Works:
				Infrastructure, Irish Modernism, and the
				Postcolonial</em></a></strong> (Notre Dame)</p>
<p><img src="/images/publicworks.jpg" alt="Public Works" width="100"
		height="146" class="right" />According to <strong>Michael
		Rubenstein</strong>, &ldquo;Irish modernism was largely a
	literary engagement with the problem of how to forge an Irish
	modernity after colonialism.&rdquo; How he goes about supporting
	this claim—by uncovering Irish modernism&rsquo;s obsession with
	public utilities—is as audacious, stunning, and ultimately
	convincing as the claim itself. In <em><strong>Public
		Works</strong></em>, Rubenstein comes at this infrastructural
	unconscious from two directions: elegant close readings of key works
	by Joyce, Flann O&rsquo;Brien, and Denis Johnston; and meticulous
	material history that turns lampposts, sewers, and other quotidian
	furniture of modernization into exemplars of a colonial process of
	modernization—a process about which the Irish had every right to be
	skeptical. This skepticism plays out within each author&rsquo;s
	works, and across them, too. While O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s <em>The
		Third Policeman</em> pits tradition and Celtic revivalism
	against the &ldquo;new dependencies&rdquo; that electrification
	exacts from the unsuspecting populace, Joyce&rsquo;s <em>Ulysses,
	</em>which Rubenstein recasts, brilliantly, as a &ldquo;postcolonial
	comedy of development,&rdquo; envisions waterworks and other
	utilities of circulation as harbingers of an independent Ireland: an
	Ireland possessing the ability to engineer itself via
	infrastructural control, thus solving &ldquo;the problem of the
	Irish underdeveloped identity.&rdquo; What makes this book
	especially remarkable is Rubenstein&rsquo;s recuperation of
	infrastructure as a technology of citizenship in general—a mechanism
	for post-colonial self-definition well beyond Ireland and its era of
	development—and as an everyday vehicle of utopian thought. </p>

	<strong>Mark Goble</strong>, <em><a
			href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14670-8/beautiful-circuits"
				><strong>Beautiful Circuits: Modernism and the Mediated
				Life</strong></a></em> (Columbia)<br /> &ldquo;The
	romantic,&rdquo; wrote Henry James of his early novel <em>The
		American</em>, stands for &ldquo;the things that reach us only
	through the beautiful circuit and subterfuge of our thought and our
	desire.&rdquo; For <strong>Mark Goble</strong>, in turn, the
	&ldquo;beautiful circuit&rdquo; stands for mediation, in its
	incarnation as a central concern of modernist literature and art.
	Living (and writing) in and through this beautiful circuit means
	reveling in the materiality of a medium, refusing the illusion of
	immediacy its conventional uses may offer, and confronting the new
	media of the electrical age as technologies that, like fiction and
	poetry before them, transform desire as much as they communicate it.
	Goble&rsquo;s magisterial book traces an alternative history of
	American modernism in which its aesthetic goal, anticipating the
	critical goals of an Adorno or a Greenberg, is to explore the
	circuitous and pariphrastic natures of technological media in order
	to articulate desire in its thoroughly modern, mediatized forms.
	These brilliant readings of James, Gertrude Stein, James Weldon
	Johnson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ralph Ellison, and James Agee—among
	others—reinvigorate our sense of American modernism as an unfinished
	project, one that has even now only begun to express how
	&ldquo;technology itself gives shape and character to experiences of
	sexuality, racial identity, class, and history, each of which in
	turn expresses something of what it means to love the media of
	modernity…and even, at times, to wonder if they love us back.&rdquo; </p>

<p>The Modernist Studies Association co-awards its 2010 Book Prize to
		<strong>Enda Duffy's<em> The Speed Handbook: Velocity, Pleasure,

			Hypothetical Mandarin</em></strong>. </p>
<p><img src="/images/speed.jpg" alt="Speed Handbook" width="100"
		height="146" class="right" /><strong>Enda Duffy's</strong>
	daring and inventive work matches exquisite readings of literature,
	film, and advertisements to a sophisticated theory of space that
	seeks to redraw the limits of modernist studies. Modernism, Duffy
	brilliantly argues, emerges when the globe itself becomes fully
	mapped and thus space itself made suddenly finite and exhaustible.
	In this historical moment, exploration gives way to speed and thus
	arrives a new array of pleasures ranging from the adrenaline rush
	through the blurred landscape to the catastrophic crash. From these
	intense experiences, <em>The Speed Handbook</em> extracts a
	radically expanded concept of modernism oriented less around space
	as such than around our movement through it. Speed thus "is not only
	a pleasure that has a politics; speed, it turns out, is politics:
	the expression of a new order of the organization of global space."
	This insight opens unexpected yet compelling connections between
	James Joyce, J.G. Ballard, Ralph Nader, and Henry Ford, all of whom
	are woven together in this broad-reaching study. The MSA Book Prize
	Committee commends this book for its critical acumen, its daring
	sweep, and its insistence on the continuing urgency of modernism as
	a cultural, political, and aesthetic project.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mandarin.jpg" alt="Hypothetical Mandarin"
		width="100" height="146" class="right" />"What is the relative
	worth to you of harm done to a Chinese stranger?" <strong>Eric
		Hayot's</strong> brilliant and wide-ranging monograph
			<em><strong>The Hypothetical Mandarin</strong></em> sees
	Adam Smith's thought experiment about conscience as the starting
	point for "a crucial figure of European thought over the last two
	centuries"--a telling point of historical and ideological
	condensation for the discourse of sympathy, and a constitutive
	element of a Western modernity that defines the concept of the human
	in relation to the seemingly arbitrary Chinese example. By tracing
	the history of this relation, weaving together a remarkable array of
	textual and visual materials, Hayot remaps modernity--not by
	reversing center and periphery, but by abandoning those models for
	one that is reciprocal and relational. In the process,
	self-reflexively examining the use of the example as an explanatory
	tool, he mounts a wry and bracing intervention into
	historical/critical discourse. With inventiveness, daring, rigor and
	brio, <em>The Hypothetical Mandarin</em> expands our very notion of
	the purview of modernist studies. For this reason, we are delighted
	to name this book the winner of the 2010 Modernist Studies
	Association Book Prize.</p>

<p><strong>William Sharpe</strong> states that the “first dark glimmer”

	the epigraph to the book, “The nights of one city are not the nights
	of another.” Sharpe’s <span style="font-style: italic">New York
		Nocturne</span> is a masterful story of this most extravagantly
	glittering of night-time cityscapes as portrayed by writers and
	artists across the late 19th and 20th centuries, a city that appears
	less and less like one of Whistler’s “moonlights,” but instead, as
	Le Corbusier described it, “a Milky Way come down to earth.” We have
	long been accustomed to thinking of art as bringing light to the
	world: considering that proposition from the other side, this book
	offers a stimulating account of the dynamic relations among
	technology and painting, photography and literature.<br />

<h2>2008 MSA Book Prize</h2>
<img src="images/clip_image002.jpg" alt="cover of book" width="100"
	height="166" class="right" />
<p>The 2008 MSA book prize was awarded to volumes 1 and 2 of
			<em><strong>modernism</strong></em>(John Benjamins
	Publishing Co, 2007), edited by <strong>Astradur
		Eysteinsson</strong> and <strong>Vivian Liska</strong>, a
	project first set in motion in the 1980s. The editors explain in
	their introduction that, between the time the book was first
	proposed to the International Comparative Literature Association and
	the time they undertook the work again, the developments in
	modernist studies required them to reconceptualise the intent and
	scope of the volumes. One of those developments, as they point out,
	was the founding 10 years ago of the Modernist Studies Association,
	the first conference of which was titled-daringly-the New
	Modernisms. It is a happy coincidence, though not an accident, that
	MSA&rsquo;s 10th anniversary and the appearance of these volumes
	should dovetail in this way.</p>
<p>The ambition of the editors is to capture, in their words, &ldquo;the
	ways modernism is viewed at the beginning of the
	twentieth-century.&rdquo; Thus the essays collected in Volume 1
	range over approaches via critical theory, technology and science,
	time and space, mind and body, and literature and the other arts.
	Volume 2 considers social and political parameters (such as racial
	politics and ecological criticism) and concepts of the sacred, of
	popular culture, and of diaspora and exile. The volume concludes
	with a section entitled &lsquo;case studies&rsquo; that considers
	the modernisms of Brazil, Australia, Catalonia, France, Spain,
	Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Nordic countries. </p>
<p>This monumental project is, in significant and heartening ways, a
	physical manifestation of the aspirations of the MSA-to consider
	modernisms as an international and interdisciplinary phenomenon.</p>

<h2>2007 MSA Book Prize</h2>
<p>The winner of the 2007 MSA Book Prize is, among other things, the
	volume that out of our fifty entrants was the most innovative in its
	own form. At base, this book is a collection of essays; but
	it&rsquo;s a collection taking an unusual shape, having unusually
	high ambitions, and succeeding unusually well in achieving its
	goals. <em><strong>Crowds</strong> (</em>Stanford University Press,
	2006), edited by Jeffrey <strong>Schnapp</strong> and
		<strong>Matthew Tiews</strong>, aims to survey the idea of the
	crowd across history and geography, not with the goal of being
	exhaustive, precisely, but with the idea of being as wide-ranging as
	possible. Thus we have essays on the myth of the &ldquo;Populus
	Romanus,&rdquo; on the crowd during the French Revolution, on masses
	and number in China, on modernist-era magazine representations of
	crowds, on mid-century sociology and the lonely crowd, on
	mentalities of the market, and on many other topics. </p>
<img src="images/clip_image004.jpg" alt="cover of book" width="100"
	height="100" class="right bookborder" />
<p>But there&rsquo;s much more to <em>Crowds</em> than breadth. For one
	thing, the contributions are of an exceptionally high
	caliber–subtle, penetrating, sometimes funny, always informative.
	And the contributions don&rsquo;t only take the form of long essays
	on historical subjects; at the margins (literally) we get
	etymologies of crowd-related terms in English, French, Hungarian,
	Chinese, Sanskrit, and many other languages; and we get personal
	recollections of being part of certain crowds, including the crowd
	at Altamont Speedway on 6 December 1969, the crowd at a Dyke March,
	the crowd at a Barney&rsquo;s Warehouse Sale. The volume is also
	replete with illustrations, sometimes happily given double-page
	spreads; and its part of a larger project that also includes art
	exhibits and an extraordinarily rich and fascinating web site. For
	its innovation, for its information, for its excitement–but above
	all for its sheer quality as a literary-historical inquiry into one
	of the great themes, one of the propelling subjects and formative
	conditions, of many modernisms–we on the committee are proud to
	award this year&rsquo;s prize to the contributors to and editors of
		<em>Crowds</em>. </p>

<h2>2006 MSA Book Prize</h2>
<p>The Book Prize Committee is delighted to speak publicly of the
	virtues of Victoria Rosner's <em>Modernism and the Architecture of
		Private Life </em>(Columbia University Press, 2004), even as the
	book aligns itself with the scaffolding of privacy. Addressing
	scholarly exchanges within Bloomsbury studies and modernism, as well
	as the recent move to phenomenology and space studies that has
	complicated the dialectic between public and private, the urban
	street and the domestic interior, Rosner gets a lot done in this
	carefully crafted book.</p>
<img src="images/clip_image005.gif" alt="cover of book" width="100"
	height="150" class="right bookborder" />
<p>It is a rare thing to be seduced by a table of contents, but the
	orchestration of chapters beginning with &quot;Kitchen Table
	Modernism,&quot; and on through &quot;Frames,&quot;
	&quot;Thresholds,&quot; &quot;Studies,&quot; and
	&quot;Interiors&quot; gives some sense of Rosner's critical
	imagination. Exquisitely balanced between the particular and the
	general, and written throughout with critical grace and acuity,
		<em>Modernism and the Architecture of Private Life</em> speaks
	with equal aplomb of dirty laundry and domestic libraries. In one
	chapter, for instance, she moves with agility from a fifteen-century
	account of European interiors dedicated to reading and writing to
	the important shift in the eighteenth century from the figure of the
	reader qua solitary male to that of the &ldquo;secular and
	gregarious woman&rdquo;-and on through Arthur Conan Doyle, Radclyff
	Hall, and A Room of One's Own: from, as Rosner memorably puts it,
	the closet to the study. </p>
<p>Most stunning is the connection Rosner forges between interiority as
	a space and interiority as a concept, or the intertwining of
	psychological and architectural tropes of selfhood. Exploring
	modernism in this way as both a spatial and temporal phenomenon, she
	intervenes in long-running conversations, with architecture
	providing the most accurate lens by which to read not only earlier
	debates in, say, Lessing and Wilhelm Worringer, but current ones in
	the work of Lauren Berlant and Elizabeth Grosz. Rosner's book will
	change modernists, even as it speaks to other voices in other rooms. <br />
	<br />
	<strong>Michael North's <span style="font-style: italic">Camera
			Works: Photography and the Twentieth-Century
		Word</span></strong> is a sweeping, powerful study that shows
	how new technologies of representation, especially photography,
	changed fundamentally the production of visual and verbal art in the
	early twentieth century. Grounding his analysis in material
	histories of photography and film, North has produced a
	transformative account of relations between the word and the image
	in twentieth-century literature and the definitive account to date
	of the influence of new media on modernism. Lucidly and with
	commanding detail, his book provides a compelling account of
	European and American responses to mechanical recording and offers
	fresh readings of several American novelists, whose encounters with
	mechanical reproduction become vivid, and in some cases visible for
	the first time, thanks to North's exhaustive archival work. <br />
	<img src="/images/north_camera_works.png" alt="cover of book"
		width="109" height="165" class="right bookborder" /><br /> The
	rich mix of materials in <span style="font-style: italic">Camera
		Works</span> is extraordinary. Not only does it uncover the
	significance of photography to the work of a stunning range of
	familiar artists such as Ernest Hemingway, Marcel Duchamp, and Pablo
	Picasso; it also brings attention to under-read figures such as John
	Dos Passos and forgotten makers such as Robert Carlton Brown -
	one-time hack writer and author of <span style="font-style: italic"
		>The Complete Book of Cheese</span> and<span
		style="font-style: italic"> Let There Be Beer</span> - whose
	&quot;readies&quot; in the early thirties in effect try to invent
	the e-book by putting words into motion through a spool-driven
	machine. Equally compelling is North's chapter on international
	modernism's struggle with sound, which shows how the arrival of
	sound in cinema disrupted film's avant-garde aspiration to provide
	&quot;a universal language of visual forms&quot;; the resulting
	crisis provoked controversy about the nature of &quot;new sign
	systems and their relation to the modern audience.&quot; Ultimately,
	North corrects longstanding misconceptions about modernism's
	supposed resistance to technological modernity by demonstrating the
	breadth and depth of its interest in new media of all kinds, and how
	this interest inspired literature and art to become modern in their
	turn.</p>

<h2>2005 MSA Book Prize</h2>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.luc.edu/msachicago/">2005 MSA Conference
		in Chicago</a>, the first annual MSA Book Prize was awarded to
		<strong>Michael Leja</strong> for <em><strong>Looking Askance:
			Skepticism and American Art from Eakins to
		Duchamp</strong></em> (University of California Press, 2004). In
	awarding the prize, the prize committee wrote:</p>
<img src="images/clip_image007.jpg" alt="book cover" width="100"
	height="142" class="right bookborder" />
<p><em>Looking Askance</em> opens up new territory in modernist studies
	by shifting the focus from artists to audiences and relocating
	modernism in everyday practices in and about early twentieth-century
	New York. Challenging assumptions that separate high art from the
	populace, Michael Leja forges connections from the ground up: as
	ordinary life itself becomes modernist, so ordinary people start to
	see art as relevant to the challenges of modern life.</p>
<p>This brilliantly pluralistic study will resonate with a broad
	spectrum of multidisciplinary interests. Tracking the way questions
	about the nature of seeing inform self-constructions of the modern
	subject, Leja moves flexibly through a wide range of surprisingly
	diverse materials, linking spirit photography, world fairs,
	circuses, automatic drawing, realist painting, and Marcel Duchamp.
	In true skeptical fashion, Leja trains his eye on the ambiguities of
	his materials, refusing to let them settle into either a celebratory
	or a cynical narrative. Opposites are revealed as similar (P. T.
	Barnum&rsquo;s humbug and George Washington&rsquo;s truth-telling
	both play on the motif of deception), while humbugs manifest
	difference (a radical fear of dishonesty versus a source of
	delight). The final illuminating shift in this complex study is thus
	from the modern need to negotiate multiple and layered realities to
	the manifold optical lenses of Leja&rsquo;s own kaleidoscopic
	approach.</p>
