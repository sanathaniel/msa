<h1>About</h1>
<p>Every other year, the Modernist Studies Association seeks nominations
	for its Edition, Anthology, or Essay Collection Prize, awarded to a
	work published in the previous two years. A panel of judges
	determines the work that made the most significant contribution to
	modernist studies. A book first published in another year will not
	be eligible for the prize. This exclusion applies even if a new
	edition (paperback or revised, for example) was published in the
	award year. 
<p>Please visit our <a href="/prize/nominate.html">Nominations</a> in
	spring 2025 to recommend a book for the next prize (for books
	published in 2023 and 2024). Visit our <a
		href="/prize/archive.html">Archive</a> to see previous
	winners.</p>
