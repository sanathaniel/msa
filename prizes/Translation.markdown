<h1>2024 Book Prize Shortlist: Translation</h1>

<!-- FIRST NOMINEE -->

<strong><p>WINNER: Shushan Avagyan, <a href="https://www.tiltedaxispress.com/a-book-untitled">A Book, Untitled, translated from Armenian by Deanna 
Cachoian-Schanz</a> (Tilted Axis Press, 2023)</p></strong>

<p>
Written as a literary experiment, <em>A Book, Untitled</em> puts Armenian modernist writers in a world, beyond their native literary landscape, populated by such contemporaries as Marina Tsvetaeva, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf. As the reader navigates 26.5 chapters of seemingly unrelated vignettes in disparate and unidentified voices, they discover that Avagyan, while writing the novel as a translator’s diary, is also mapping out a larger archival or archaeological site: an imagined encounter between Kurghinian and Yesayan, whose legacies have been censored by the Tsarist and Stalinist regimes. The imagined encounter in 1926 is juxtaposed with a contemporary conversation between the novel’s unnamed narrator—an archivist and translator referred to as the “typist/writer”—and her friend Lara, who are both piecing together the writers’ fragmented stories.

<strong><p>Marcel Proust, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674271012">The Seventy-Five Folios and Other Unpublished Manuscripts, 
translated from French by Sam Taylor</a> (Harvard University Press, 2023)</p></strong>

<p>
Presented for the first time in English, the recently discovered early manuscripts of the twentieth century’s most towering literary figure offer uncanny glimpses of his emerging genius and the creation of his masterpiece. One of the most significant literary events of the century, the discovery of manuscript pages containing early drafts of Marcel Proust’s <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> put an end to a decades-long search for the Proustian grail. The Paris publisher Bernard de Fallois claimed to have viewed the folios, but doubts about their existence emerged when none appeared in the Proust manuscripts bequeathed to the Bibliothèque Nationale in 1962. The texts had in fact been hidden among Fallois’s private papers, where they were found upon his death in 2018. <em>The Seventy-Five Folios and Other Unpublished Manuscripts</em> presents these folios here for the first time in English, along with seventeen other brief unpublished texts. Extensive commentary and notes by the Proust scholar Nathalie Mauriac Dyer offer insightful critical analysis.

<p> 

<strong><p>Fradl Shtok, <a href="https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810144392/from-the-jewish-provinces/">From the Jewish Provinces: Selected Stories, translated from 
Yiddish by Jordan Finkin and Allison Schachter</a> (Northwestern University 
Press, 2022)</p></strong>

<p>
The translation of Fradl Shtok’s From the <em>Jewish Provinces</em> revives a nearly forgotten collection of Yiddish modernist masterpieces. Shtok’s collection of short stories represents one of the only known volumes of Yiddish modernist short fiction authored by a woman. In sophisticated prose, the stories describe the travails of young women looking for love and desire in a world that spurns them. These young Jewish women struggle with disabled bodies, sexual violence, and unwanted marriage. Some strive to imagine themselves as artists, while others lose themselves in fantasy worlds or look with desperate longing at the non-Jewish men that surround them. Through deft portraits of her characters’ inner worlds Shtok gives us access to unglimpsed corners of the Jewish imagination. The translation intervenes in the literary history of Yiddish prose to show women’s active participation in modernist experimentation.

<strong><p>Murathan Mungan, <a href="https://df83e96a84d8529ac3a1-b14d7eeab70e892e89289d791c854243.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/s/1/1647026527/northwest_298W/3715.jpg">Valor: Stories, translated from Turkish by Aron Aji and 
David Gramling</a> (Northwestern University Press, 2022)</p></strong>

<p>
Among the array of Turkish literature available in English, one of the most glaring gaps is the work of Murathan Mungan (b. 1955), author of over sixty books--of poetry, fiction, plays, screenplays and essays--produced in the course of a forty-year writing career. To date, only a handful of his poems and short fiction have appeared in English (many in Aji’s and Gramling’s own co-translations), and no book-length work had been translated yet until <em>Valor. Cenk Hikayeleri/Valor</em> (1986) has long been considered by Turkish critics as a milestone of modern Turkish literature deserving of international reception. <em>Valor</em> reflects most vividly the author’s multi-ethnic, Kurdish-Arab-Turkish background, and represents his lush poetics, literary breadth, and his enduring sociopolitical commitments.

		<strong>WINNERS: Kirby Brown, Stephen Ross, and Alana Sayers, eds. <em><a

					target="_blank">The Routledge Handbook of North
					American Indigenous Modernisms</a></em> (Routledge,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>The <em>Routledge Handbook of North American Indigenous
			Modernisms</em> explores Indigenous lives, literatures, and
		cultural productions in North American from the late nineteenth
		and early twentieth centuries. The volume crucially reshapes
		canonicity in this period, attending to the ways that, in
		contributor Philip J. Deloria’s words, “Indigenous Modernism
		transformed the modern itself.” Chapters are exemplary for their
		interdisciplinary scope and transnational juxtapositions, taking
		up the ties between Indigenous and Black communities in the
		Mississippi Delta, oral histories of the General Allotment Act,
		representations of indigeneity in Caribbean print cultures, and
		the Alaska Native solidarity networks, amongst other historical
		and political constellations. The volume highlights key figures
		of Indigenous cultural production and activism, including
		Zitkála-Šá, Lynn Riggs, Paul Green, Henry Starr, Mourning Dove,
		John Joseph Mathews, Joy Harjo, and Kent Monkman. Insisting upon
		the centrality of settler-colonial dispossession to any
		accounting of the modern, alongside longstanding histories of
		native survivance, this powerful account of Indigenous thought
		and action will be an essential resource for scholars and
		teachers.<br /><br /></p>

					target="_blank">Time for Reparations: A Global
					Perspective</a></em> (University of Pennsylvania
			Press, 2021)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Time for Reparations</em> is an intervention that the New
		Modernist Studies needs. The multidisciplinary contributors in
		this essay collection explicate the global “traces carved by
		unrepaired past injustice”— the long-lasting pain that various
		nations, peoples, and communities endure. This collection raises
		questions that will help reorient the theoretical and historical
		horizons of the New Modernist Studies. For example: how do past
		injustices transmit across generations and shape present
		disempowerment? What are responsible and effective forms of
		reparation? How does activist scholarship link the histories of
		injustices to contemporary political changes? Through these
		questions, <em>Time for Reparations</em> traces how the past
		remains central to current injustices through four topical
		sections—“Addressing the Legacy of Slavery,” “Reparations:
		Precedents and Lessons Learned,” and “Outstanding Issues:
		Unrepaired State-Sponsored Collective Injustice,” and “Ways
		Forward for Reparations.” <em>Time for Reparations</em>
		catalyzes a fundamental shift of conceptual frameworks in
		approaching twentieth-century political and cultural histories.

		<strong>Rachel Farebrother & Miriam Thaggert, eds., <em><a
					href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-of-the-harlem-renaissance/FA8A4106E9340E65106B1EF892EF92AF?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark"
					target="_blank">A History of the Harlem
					Renaissance</a></em> (Cambridge University Press,
			2021)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Rachel Farebrother and Miriam Thaggert’s <em>A History of the
			Harlem Renaissance</em> is an exceptionally thoughtful
		volume that brings fresh perspective to a much-studied period of
		literary innovation. The titular qualifier that announces this
		as a history, rather than the history, acknowledges the
		contributions to the field that have preceded it, and sets off
		the work of this volume as additive, or, as the editors put it
		in their introduction, as participating in “a long tradition of
		revising, re-reading, and remaking the Harlem Renaissance” (11).
		It makes welcome additions and revisions indeed, both bringing
		new texts into the spotlight and refocusing scholarly attention
		on form and genre in particular. Bringing together literature
		with visual culture, popular culture, dance, and music, the book
		covers well-known genres and also exceeds them to attend to
		biography, bildungsroman, roman à clef, children’s literature,
		short story, film, and more. The volume is not only an
		introduction to the literature and history of the period, but
		also to the histories, theories, and methodologies of the
		scholarship that has been published about it. The editors’
		introduction usefully outlines the ways in which African
		American literary criticism and black studies more broadly can
		be historicised by attending to the ways that the stakes of the
		field have been articulated through iterative reevaluations of
		the cultural production of the Harlem Renaissance period, and an
		afterword by Deborah McDowell assesses what the scholarship
		collected here portends for the future of the field. Across four
		sections of critical essays engaged with “Re-Reading,”
		“Experimenting,” “Re-Mapping,” and “Performing” the New Negro,
		the contributors offer exceptionally incisive and insightful
		considerations, both deep and wide-ranging, of the history and
		legacy of this influential movement in African American literary
		history.<br /><br />

					target="_blank">Radical Dreams: Surrealism,
					Counterculture, Resistance</a></em> (Pennsylvania
			State University Press, 2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Radical Dreams: Surrealism, Counterculture, Resistance</em>
		shifts the traditional timeline of the surrealist movement,
		moving beyond the interwar period to the 1960s, 1970s, and
		1980s. This shift highlights the ties between a surrealist
		aesthetic and radical politics, turning to the affinity groups,
		underground subcultures, and student protest movements that
		pronounced a commitment to surrealism as a mode of
		anti-authoritarian resistance. A reconsideration of “Surrealism
		as Radicalism,” as the introductory essay posits, leads to a
		suite of essays that are particularly impressive for their
		interdisciplinary breadth and transnational contours. Chapters
		turn to the student protests of May ’68, Afrosurrealism, the
		Situationist International, the Wobblies, and London punk. New
		constellations emerge through the juxtaposition of a variety of
		artists and political actors, including Charles Fourier, Roberto
		Matta, Robert Rauschenberg, and Ted Joans. Drawing out the
		interactions between late surrealist currents and a variety of
		New Left political formations, spanning the sexual revolution to
			<em>Earth First!</em>, this volume importantly reshapes the
		historical contours of surrealism’s legacy.<br /><br /></p>
