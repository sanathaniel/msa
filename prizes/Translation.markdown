		<strong>WINNERS: Kirby Brown, Stephen Ross, and Alana Sayers, eds. <em><a
					href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-North-American-Indigenous-Modernisms/Brown-Ross-Sayers/p/book/9780367466442"
					target="_blank">The Routledge Handbook of North
					American Indigenous Modernisms</a></em> (Routledge,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>The <em>Routledge Handbook of North American Indigenous
			Modernisms</em> explores Indigenous lives, literatures, and
		cultural productions in North American from the late nineteenth
		and early twentieth centuries. The volume crucially reshapes
		canonicity in this period, attending to the ways that, in
		contributor Philip J. Deloria’s words, “Indigenous Modernism
		transformed the modern itself.” Chapters are exemplary for their
		interdisciplinary scope and transnational juxtapositions, taking
		up the ties between Indigenous and Black communities in the
		Mississippi Delta, oral histories of the General Allotment Act,
		representations of indigeneity in Caribbean print cultures, and
		the Alaska Native solidarity networks, amongst other historical
		and political constellations. The volume highlights key figures
		of Indigenous cultural production and activism, including
		Zitkála-Šá, Lynn Riggs, Paul Green, Henry Starr, Mourning Dove,
		John Joseph Mathews, Joy Harjo, and Kent Monkman. Insisting upon
		the centrality of settler-colonial dispossession to any
		accounting of the modern, alongside longstanding histories of
		native survivance, this powerful account of Indigenous thought
		and action will be an essential resource for scholars and
		teachers.<br /><br /></p>

					target="_blank">Time for Reparations: A Global
					Perspective</a></em> (University of Pennsylvania
			Press, 2021)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Time for Reparations</em> is an intervention that the New
		Modernist Studies needs. The multidisciplinary contributors in
		this essay collection explicate the global “traces carved by
		unrepaired past injustice”— the long-lasting pain that various
		nations, peoples, and communities endure. This collection raises
		questions that will help reorient the theoretical and historical
		horizons of the New Modernist Studies. For example: how do past
		injustices transmit across generations and shape present
		disempowerment? What are responsible and effective forms of
		reparation? How does activist scholarship link the histories of
		injustices to contemporary political changes? Through these
		questions, <em>Time for Reparations</em> traces how the past
		remains central to current injustices through four topical
		sections—“Addressing the Legacy of Slavery,” “Reparations:
		Precedents and Lessons Learned,” and “Outstanding Issues:
		Unrepaired State-Sponsored Collective Injustice,” and “Ways
		Forward for Reparations.” <em>Time for Reparations</em>
		catalyzes a fundamental shift of conceptual frameworks in
		approaching twentieth-century political and cultural histories.

		<strong>Rachel Farebrother & Miriam Thaggert, eds., <em><a
					href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-of-the-harlem-renaissance/FA8A4106E9340E65106B1EF892EF92AF?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark"
					target="_blank">A History of the Harlem
					Renaissance</a></em> (Cambridge University Press,
			2021)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Rachel Farebrother and Miriam Thaggert’s <em>A History of the
			Harlem Renaissance</em> is an exceptionally thoughtful
		volume that brings fresh perspective to a much-studied period of
		literary innovation. The titular qualifier that announces this
		as a history, rather than the history, acknowledges the
		contributions to the field that have preceded it, and sets off
		the work of this volume as additive, or, as the editors put it
		in their introduction, as participating in “a long tradition of
		revising, re-reading, and remaking the Harlem Renaissance” (11).
		It makes welcome additions and revisions indeed, both bringing
		new texts into the spotlight and refocusing scholarly attention
		on form and genre in particular. Bringing together literature
		with visual culture, popular culture, dance, and music, the book
		covers well-known genres and also exceeds them to attend to
		biography, bildungsroman, roman à clef, children’s literature,
		short story, film, and more. The volume is not only an
		introduction to the literature and history of the period, but
		also to the histories, theories, and methodologies of the
		scholarship that has been published about it. The editors’
		introduction usefully outlines the ways in which African
		American literary criticism and black studies more broadly can
		be historicised by attending to the ways that the stakes of the
		field have been articulated through iterative reevaluations of
		the cultural production of the Harlem Renaissance period, and an
		afterword by Deborah McDowell assesses what the scholarship
		collected here portends for the future of the field. Across four
		sections of critical essays engaged with “Re-Reading,”
		“Experimenting,” “Re-Mapping,” and “Performing” the New Negro,
		the contributors offer exceptionally incisive and insightful
		considerations, both deep and wide-ranging, of the history and
		legacy of this influential movement in African American literary
		history.<br /><br />

		<strong>Eliot H. King and Abigail Susik, eds., <em><a

					target="_blank">Radical Dreams: Surrealism,
					Counterculture, Resistance</a></em> (Pennsylvania
			State University Press, 2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Radical Dreams: Surrealism, Counterculture, Resistance</em>
		shifts the traditional timeline of the surrealist movement,
		moving beyond the interwar period to the 1960s, 1970s, and
		1980s. This shift highlights the ties between a surrealist
		aesthetic and radical politics, turning to the affinity groups,
		underground subcultures, and student protest movements that
		pronounced a commitment to surrealism as a mode of
		anti-authoritarian resistance. A reconsideration of “Surrealism
		as Radicalism,” as the introductory essay posits, leads to a
		suite of essays that are particularly impressive for their
		interdisciplinary breadth and transnational contours. Chapters
		turn to the student protests of May ’68, Afrosurrealism, the
		Situationist International, the Wobblies, and London punk. New
		constellations emerge through the juxtaposition of a variety of
		artists and political actors, including Charles Fourier, Roberto
		Matta, Robert Rauschenberg, and Ted Joans. Drawing out the
		interactions between late surrealist currents and a variety of
		New Left political formations, spanning the sexual revolution to
			<em>Earth First!</em>, this volume importantly reshapes the
		historical contours of surrealism’s legacy.<br /><br /></p>
