<h2>MSA Book Prize</h2>
<p>The Modernist Studies Association seeks nominations for this year’s MSA Book Prize, which will honor books with a copyright date of 2023. The prize is given each year to a work that makes a significant contribution to modernist studies. The winner will receive $1000 plus up to $600 toward travel expenses to the November 2024 MSA conference in Chicago, IL, where the award will be presented, and will be asked to chair the subsequent year’s award.</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
To nominate a book for the MSA Book Prize, please send (or have the publisher send) a hard copy of the nominated book to each of three jurors:
</p>
