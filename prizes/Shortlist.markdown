 <h1>About</h1>
<p>Each year, the Modernist Studies Association seeks nominations for
	its Book Prize, awarded to a book published in the
	previous year. A panel of judges determines the book that made the
	most significant contribution to modernist studies. A book initially
	published in another year will not be eligible for the prize. This
	exclusion applies even if a new edition (paperback or revised, for
	example) was published in the award year.<br />
<p>Please visit our <a href="/prize/nominate.html">Nominations page</a>
	in Spring 2025 to recommend a book(                              published in 2024). Visit our <a href="/prize/archive.html"
