	<strong>WINNER: Peter Kalliney, <em><a
				href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691230634/the-aesthetic-cold-war"
				target="_blank">The Aesthetic Cold War</a></em>
		(Princeton University Press, 2022)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Aesthetic Cold War is a major revision of our picture of Cold War
	aesthetics and politics, giving us a far more complex picture of old
	narratives of cultural co-option during literary decolonization.
	Kalliney’s is the new standard work on the relation of
	decolonial-era writers to Soviet realism, CIA funding, and cold war
	politics. He argues that many key debates in postcolonial studies —
	autonomy against political utility, indigeneity versus
	cosmopolitanism — were “formed in the crucible of the aesthetic cold
	war.” Taking up writers from Africa, China, the West Indies and
	elsewhere, this book is an astonishing archival achievement, mixing
	new findings about the origins of the major literary movements of
	the decolonial and postcolonial periods with detailed readings of
	key literary figures, alongside the files of the intelligence
	agencies who cultivated them (and whom they used in turn). Kalliney
	finally argues that decolonial and postcolonial-era writers, rather
	than dupes of either socialist realism or CIA-backed “cultural
	freedom,” were "canny operators" who played one side of the Cold War
	against the other. As he does so, he makes an eloquent case against
	the naivété of ideological and social determinism in political
	readings of de- and post-colonial writers now.</p>

	<strong>HONORABLE MENTION: Michael Lucey, <em><a
				href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo130500168.html"
				target="_blank">What Proust Heard: Novels and the
				Ethnography of Talk</a></em> (University of Chicago
		Press, 2022)</strong>
<p>What Proust Heard is an astonishing linguistic experiment in the
	monograph form, by the way of "language-in-use" in Proust. Lucey
	argues that a linguistic-anthropological approach to talking in the
		<em>Search</em> forces us to rethink reported speech in George
	Eliot, Dostoyevsky, Natalie Sarraute, and the enigmatic narrator of
	Rachel Cusk’s <em>Outline</em> trilogy, as well as our own talking
	about talk. In addition to a searching exploration of social data
	and listening as ethnology in Proust, Lucey’s book brings into
	conversation several fields of the social sciences, from literary
	sociology to anthropology to Bourdieu’s lectures on artistic
	distinction. Continually translating between languages, moving
	fluidly from Proust’s own post-aristocratic moment to our own idiom,
	Lucey writes with the eye and ear of a great essayist. <em>What
		Proust Heard</em> enacts its argument about Proust’s practice of
	listening through its own immersion in the speech and thinking of
	others, in a tour-de-force of essayistic close reading and close
	hearing.</p>

	<strong>Bette London, <em><a href="">Posthumous Lives: World War I
				and the Culture of Memory</a></em> (Cornell University
		Press, 2022) </strong>
</p>
<p><em>Posthumous Lives</em> is an innovative and beautifully written
	cultural history of the afterlife of World War I and its
	commemoration in Britain. Bette London addresses an exciting range
	of materials, archives, and forms in her exploration of the culture
	of war memory, including centennial celebrations, private
	commemorative volumes, the “War Poets” and the strange attachment to
	the figure of C. H. Sorley, Virginia Woolf’s counter-memorial
	archive in <em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, and contemporary memorials
	to soldiers “shot at dawn” by their own officers. As she does so,
	she brings to light both the uses of historical war memory and the
	war over historical memory itself. “What are the consequences,” she
	asks, “of investing in the posthumous life as the governing
	structure of memorialization?” <em>Posthumous Lives</em> is a lucid,
	poised, unsentimental reconsideration of an entire way of
	remembering, challenging our continuing attachment to certain
	posthumous memories at the expense of others. </p>

	<strong>Kobena Mercer, <em><a
				href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300247268/alain-locke-and-the-visual-arts/"
				target="_blank">Alain Locke and the Visual Arts</a></em>
		(Yale University Press, 2022)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Alain Locke and the Visual Arts</em> is a visually stunning and
	deeply learned re-reading of Locke as a cultural and also artistic
	theorist of Black arts across the whole span of his career. Mercer
	places Locke within the context of a larger exploration of Black
	aesthetic culture and signification, moving easily from a renovation
	of Locke’s culturalism to his role in establishing an
	“Afro-modernist” aesthetic to the question of Locke’s sexuality and
	the “Homo Negro” in art. Mercer’s book is a major contribution to
	the culturalist re-thinking of the Renaissance and its aftermath
	across media forms and moments of institutionalization. <em>Alain
		Locke and the Visual Arts</em> is beautifully written and
	gorgeously illustrated with an astonishing archive of “Afromodern”
	art, sculpture, and photographs, with which both Locke and Mercer
	are in conversation. This book justifies Locke’s faith in the
	African and modernist art criticism to come. </p>

	<strong>Arthur Rose, <em><a
				href="https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-asbestos-the-last-modernist-object.html"
				target="_blank">Asbestos–The Last Modernist
			Object</a></em> (Edinburgh University Press, 2022)</strong>
</p>
<p>This surprising and original history of asbestos offers a compelling
	investigation of the material as a modernist object. The book shows
	us what literary criticism can do differently in attending to
	material life, giving us accounts of various historical, literary,
	and biographical accounts of literary figures’ encounters with
	asbestos, but also a reckoning with a family history of South
	African asbestos mining. To write about asbestos, Rose tells us, is
	to write about its use. It is also, as he makes abundantly clear, to
	write not just about its toxic legacy, but about its utopian promise
	to insulate the future from a possible risk, which carries all the
	dangers inherent to such a technological and capitalist idea. Rose
	shows how paying extraordinarily minute literary critical attention
	to one single material – its history, its associations, its rich
	potential for narrative – can cast light on swathes of cultural
	history; <em>Asbestos – The Last Modernist Object</em> offers a
	fascinating movement between medical, personal and literary spaces.
	Indeed, asbestos offers Rose a subject ripe for a Latourian account
	of its treatment as not just a substance, but as metaphor; for
	latent potential, for resource extraction, and for our understanding
	of waste; and as a material object with a degree of complex and
	ambivalent animacy or liveliness. In doing so the book tracks
	asbestos’s movement across entire domains of cultural and
	epistemological space. Recasting its positioning as a banned
	substance, Rose explores what happens to asbestos even as his
	account acknowledges that it cannot undo the material history of its
	creation and use. ‘We must work out ways to endure asbestos time’,
	he writes, and in doing so, the book shows us a new way of
	understanding the history of substances via the methods of literary
	scholarship.</p>

	<strong>Paul Stasi, <em><a
				href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/persistence-of-realism-in-modernist-fiction/15AD4C15FA7546DFF6B1D6CBCFA16416"
				target="_blank">The Persistence of Realism in Modernist
				Fiction</a></em> (Cambridge University Press, 2022)
	</strong>
</p>
<p> Paul Stasi’s <em>The Persistence of Realism in Modernist
		Fiction</em>, a thorough defense of the insuperable dialectic of
	realism and modernism within all modernist-era fiction, achieves
	something very rare. Engaging the entrenched conflict between
	partisans of modernism and realism, it manages to not only say
	something new, but to offer brilliant readings of some of
	modernism’s central figures. His question is simple, even while the
	answer cannot be: was modernism a rejection of realism, or a
	development from it? Does it represent continuity or rupture? For
	Stasi, realism persists – not merely in the period, but in the very
	texts that are held up as axiomatically anti-realist, and its formal
	concerns cannot ever be seen as separate from those which have
	always animated realism. The way through this argument is laced with
	landmines – the potential for creating strawmen or simplifications
	is clear – but Stasi’s book is an exemplar of a clear and compelling
	argument, one that sets out to change minds and cast light on the
	period and on the individual texts from <em>Ulysses</em> to <em>The
		Years</em> to <em>Invisible Man</em>, all of which he
	close-reads with huge skill.</p>
