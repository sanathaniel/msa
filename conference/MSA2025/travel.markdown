        <h2><strong>Getting to Chicago</strong></h2>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Chicago is serviced by two international airports, O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Midway International Airport (MDW).</p>
        
        <p>Most visitors will fly into O’Hare International Airport (ORD), which has many quick and affordable transit options to the Gold Coast.</p>
        
        <p>Midway International Airport (MDW) is actually closer to our venue, and a bit easier to navigate than O’Hare, but also services fewer flight routes. It may be a particularly good option for those using regional airlines.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p><strong>By “L” Train</strong></p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>The cheapest option for traveling from either airport to the Drake is the CTA.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>From O’Hare The Blue Line provides direct transit from the airport to the Loop (downtown Chicago). In the Loop, you can either transfer to the northbound Red Line at Washington Station, disembark at the Chicago stop, and then walk 5–10 minutes northeast; or transfer to a bus (146 or 151) at Monroe Station, which will take you directly to the hotel. L-Train fare from O’Hare is $5. </p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>The CTA’s Orange Line will get you from Midway to the Loop in about 45 minutes. You can either transfer to the northbound Red Line at Roosevelt Station, disembark at the Chicago stop, and then walk 5–10 minutes northeast; or transfer to a bus (146 or 151) at Washington/Wabash Station, which will take you directly to the hotel. L-Train fare from Midway is $2.50. </p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>You cannot use cash to pay CTA
train fares, but most transit stations (including O’Hare) have transit card
vending machines. Bus fares can be paid using cash or a Ventra card. The train
and bus also accept Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.  A Ventra card is
required for transfers.  For more information visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ventrachicago.com/how-to/mobile-wallet-apps/">Ventra card</a> website. </p>

        <p><strong>Taxi and Ride Share</strong></p>
        
        <p></p>
