<p></p>

<p>During the registration process, you will have the opportunity to select a seminar should you wish to participate in one (seminar titles and descriptions are listed below). In advance of the seminar meeting at MSA, participants produce short papers in response to the seminar topic description and share them with the entire group through whatever mechanism the seminar leaders devise. All participants are to read all of the participants’ papers—a process that aims to ensure careful and significant dialogue on the topic. Seminars take place at MSA in blocks of two hours and thirty minutes. Typically, the first two hours are devoted to specific discussion of the topic by seminar participants and the final thirty minutes allow room for questions, general discussion, and/or participation of auditors, if relevant.
  </p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>ROLES: SEMINAR LEADERS and INVITED PARTICIPANTS</strong></h1>

<p>Seminars are led by anywhere between one and three leaders who have some experience or knowledge foundational to the seminar topic, and who can represent different professional stages or institutional statuses.</p>
<p>Some seminar leaders choose to invite a few people to join a seminar in some special role—usually scholars with special interest or expertise in the topic. It is entirely up to seminar leaders whether to exercise this option or not. All seminar leaders are welcome to invite up to two invited participants and can determine their precise role. Seminar organizers are, however, strongly urged to require invited participants to produce papers or prepare responses for the seminar in order to feed the dialogue of the seminar and to make the best use of everyone’s time.</p>
<p>Seminars function best when they foster considered, sustained intellectual dialogue anchored in the work that seminar participants circulate in advance and a lively conversation among peers during the seminar itself. Repeated experience suggests that seminars also function best when all participants, with the exception of the seminar leader(s), produce fresh, written work for the occasion.</p>
<p>The MSA encourages seminar leaders to discuss with invited participants the role they will play in the seminar in the earliest stages of the planning process.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>AUDITORS</strong></h1>

<p>Seminars are limited to a set number of participants. By default, auditors are NOT permitted; seminar leaders may, however, choose to allow auditors but must inform the conference organizers.</p>

<p></p>

<h1><strong>PRE-CONFERENCE GUIDELINES</strong></h1>

<p>Seminar leaders should set firm guidelines for each seminar from their first or second contact with seminar participants. These should include, at a minimum:
</p>
	
<p>Seminar leaders should set firm guidelines for each seminar from their first or second contact with seminar participants. These should include, <strong>at a minimum:</strong></p>

	<blockquote display="list-item">
        <li><strong>A deadline for submission of written work</strong> (preferably about six weeks before the conference).  <strong>It is MSA’s policy that participants who do not submit written work will not be listed in the conference program for a seminar.</strong> It is perfectly appropriate to be tough: More than one seminar has suffered because participants did not have sufficient time to read all of the papers carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>A recommended length for seminar papers (typically 5 to 7 pages).</strong></li>
		<li><strong>The procedure for sharing of written work.</strong></li>
    </blockquote>

<p><strong>Other guidelines</strong>  are up to individual leaders and can lend seminars their unique styles. In the past, some leaders have provided a list of recommended readings and/or a list of questions the group should consider. Some have assigned participants to generate detailed critiques of each other’s work in pairs or small groups, in addition to all of the participants reading each other’s work. Leaders have also given specific paper guidelines guiding content (encouraging or discouraging textual, theoretical, or methodological analysis, e.g.).</p>

<h1><strong>CONFERENCE GUIDELINES</strong></h1>

<p>The seminar leader acts as a facilitator, rather than an instructor, in conducting this discussion among peers. It is the seminar leader’s job to ensure that the dialogue is inclusive; a leader must not allow one or two participants to dominate and should exercise the chair’s prerogative to steer discussion in a way that includes everyone. No responsibility is more important than making sure that everyone gets to participate fully, and that everyone’s submission gets attention.</p>

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p1">Making Creative Work Across Forms: Modernist Prompts and Provocations</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Claire Battershill, Amy Elkins, and Sheryda Warrener</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Oulipo language games, the literary parlour activities of the Bloomsbury group's "memoir club" and other momentary creative collaborative exercises show us the vibrant energy of constraint and play in a shared space. The "prompt" or "provocation" (to use the Black Mountain College term) offers us a chance to engage as contemporary creative practitioners and scholars with the kinds of creativity that is born of formal limitation and of transmedial engagements between and across the arts. When Yoko Ono tells us, for example, in Grapefruit to "break your mirror and scatter the pieces in different countries" she offers both a literal instruction and a sense of speculative poetic impossibility. In this seminar, we invite participants to think about the kinds of prompts, provocations, exercises, and games that modernist literature and artistic practice across media can offer contemporary scholars and creative practitioners. We seek to engage with transmedial praxis as both a conceptual apparatus for studying the period and as a scholarly method—a way of thinking more inclusively and dynamically about the work of scholarship itself. Therefore, this seminar will take an unconventional and deliberately procedural format: we will invite participants to share examples of their own creative/critical engagements with modernist procedural or provocative literature in advance; then, during the session itself, we will spend most of the time engaging in material prompts and provocations inspired by modernist works and will consider the ways in which modernist constructions of creative constraint can offer us new possibilities for making work in the present.

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p2">Feminist Migrations in Publishing: Where Do We Go from Here?</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Erica Delsandro and Laurel Harris</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Even while feminist inquiry has established its importance in modernist studies, the borders between traditional and feminist scholarly practices remain. Feminist scholarship has prompted a questioning of scholarly audience, subject, and media that has been particularly responsive to radical institutional shifts in the humanities. At the same time, this scholarship has often been perceived as niche or eccentric in traditional academic contexts. In this seminar, participants will reflect on who they hope to reach and what they hope to do with their scholarship. Feminist publication is often migratory, seeking new venues and receptive communities. In this seminar, we will explore where and how we find, create, and shape these spaces.
				</p>
				<p>Seminar participants will not produce position papers for this seminar; rather, they will respond to a series of shared prompts, creating a collective text addressing the questions below. We welcome scholars who are or have been in editing roles–journal editors, series editors, guest editors, etc.--who can speak to feminist praxis as well as anyone interested in exploring forms of and venues for feminist scholarship.
				</p>
					<blockquote display="list-item">
						<li>If you had the time and space to write whatever you liked, would the genres in which you write, the audience for whom you write, and/or the subjects on which you write shift?
						</li>
						<li>Is there anything important to you that you have started to write but stopped because you didn’t know where it would go?

						</li>
						<li>Which publication venues–if any–most fit the scholarship you do or would like to do, and why?
						</li>
						<li>To what extent do you think feminist scholarship should challenge traditional forms and genres and why?
						</li>
						<li>How would you describe an ideal publication venue for explicitly feminist work?
						</li>How can we reimagine the academic peer review and publishing process to more closely align with contemporary (intersectional and anti-racist) feminist goals and ideals?
						<li>How do we articulate and advocate for the value of work that is non-traditional in terms of genre, audience, and/or subjects?

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p3">Intimate Methods
</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Jess Shollenberger and Laura Tscherry</strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Invited participant: Melanie Micir</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Intimacy is both a feeling and a spatial or formal arrangement. As a method for modernist studies, intimacy enables a range of approaches to difficult, unruly objects—those resistant to repair and, as often, integration into field formations, political frameworks, histories, and canons. For example: the “terrible we” of maladjusted, backward figures trans studies has had to disavow to gain legitimacy as a field (Awkward-Rich, The Terrible We); the Black and sometimes queer “minor figures” who, in the afterlife of slavery and as a matter of survival, transformed gender, sexuality, and domestic and intimate life (Hartman, Wayward Lives); and the biographical “passion projects” of modernist women writers bent on crafting alternative histories that would include their lovers and friends (Micir, The Passion Projects).

				</p>
				<p>In this seminar, we seek to explore how intimate practices of research, reading, and writing have been useful and remain crucial to minoritarian studies and specifically Black, queer, trans, feminist, and disability studies approaches to the study of modernism. What does it mean to fall in love with a text, to cathect to or (mis)recognize its latent or overt queer/trans/crip/BIPOC possibilities? Alongside love, investment, fantasy, and the legitimizing power of proximity and attention, what might intimacy enable us to unlearn and disrupt about our objects and our disciplines?
				</p>
				<p>We welcome papers that probe the intellectual roots of intimate scholarship (in Benjamin’s The Arcades Project or Barthes’s S/Z, for example) and/or chart pathways for its future in and beyond modernist studies. We acknowledge the work being done to “deidealize” objects of study in minoritarian fields, yet we remain curious about the potentials and potential failures of intimacy configured as a mode of critical practice (Amin, Disturbing Attachments).

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p4">Modernism & Photography</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Christine Fouirnaies and Christos Hadjiyiannis </strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Invited responders: Alejandra Uslenghi and Emily Setina</strong>
				</p>
				<p>From its origins in the nineteenth century through to its many developments and reconfigurations over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, photography has intrigued and invigorated literary practice, providing writers with fresh and different opportunities for expression. At the same time, the coming together of writing and photography (a link made obvious by the term’s etymology: writing with light) became a lens through which literary and media theorists sought to see the world – and engage with it.
				</p>
				<p>This seminar would consider the coming together of literature and photography during the broad modernist era and across different geographies, genres, and languages. What has photography afforded modernist literature? What new things did photography make possible to say? What radical new ways of seeing, representing, and constructing the world has photography presented for modernist writers and readers? What joins modernist writing and photography? What keeps them apart? How did modernist literature respond to advancements in photographic technology?
				</p>
				<p>This panel will be led by two scholars working within modernism and photography and who are at the early stages of editing a companion on the subject. For this seminar, we call for brief position papers (5-7 pages) on any work (including work in progress) that engages with modernism and photography. These papers will be pre-circulated, we will match participants, and ask each seminar attendee to respond to one paper on the day. We are also delighted to have with us two leaders in the field as invited participants who have been asked to share with us their most recent work and talk about the state of the field. 
				</p>
				<p>The discussion will be structured, congenial, and inclusive; the organisers are committed to ensuring that everyone gets the chance to speak and to be heard.
				</p>
				<p>It is the organisers' hope that many participants would be interested in being part of the edited companion the organisers are planning.

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p5">Melodrama and Modernism
</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leader: Josh Epstein
</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This seminar proposes to explore the modernist melodrama—and the relationship between “modernism” and “melodrama” as cultural categories—highlighting the performative dimensions of modernism and the avant-garde. Building on a resurgent critical interest in the melodrama—among them, Ben Singer on the “modernity thesis”; Carolyn Williams and Peter Kivy on melodrama and realist fiction; Ben Kohlmann on Auden and Isherwood; Linda Williams on race melodramas and “body genres”; Victoria Evans on Douglas Sirk—we will consider how melodramas stage the conflicted affects of modernity, and inform modernism even (especially?) at its most neoclassical. Questions we ask may include: How do melodramas of race (e.g. Micheaux, Griffith, Fleming/Selznick, Stahl, Sirk) capitalize on or critique the genre’s emotional excesses in thinking through historicity and national community; in what ways do these texts question the politics of sentiment? In what respects are avant-garde manifestos a rhetorical or typographical approximation of melodramatic performance? To what effect do modernist representations of labor, class, and consumer culture counterpoint images of the workplace with those of sentimentalized domesticity? How do modernist representations of sexuality, reproduction, and abortion complicate the melodrama’s domestic sensibilities (e.g. Lois Weber’s Where Are My Children; Jean Rhys’s Voyage in the Dark; Mina Loy’s The Sacred Prostitute); in what ways does modernist melodrama evoke a queer “aesthetics of impossibility” (Jonathan Goldberg)? How do opera, the stage or film musical, the Singspiel, the radio ballad, Joyce’s “Circe” episode, or Schoenberg’s serialist song cycle Pierrot lunaire reflect alternative approaches to the melos in melodrama? How do documentary and propaganda across media both resist and partake in melodramatic sentimentality? How do film representations of modernist texts highlight or distort their latent or explicit melodramatics? Papers on any genre, medium, or period are welcome; perspectives on late Victorian or postmodern melodrama would throw into relief the elasticity of our central terms.

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p6">Tracing Migrations through Commodities in Modernist Literature</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Michelle Witen and Kiron Ward</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This seminar will address the relationships between migration, cultural production, and Modernist literature, reading them alongside the multinational production of popular commodities such as comestibles, textiles, fabrics, organic and inorganic materials.

				</p>
				<p>Building on our recent and ongoing work on cocoa and tea (i.e., the cultural impact of Cadbury’s activities in Britain, West Africa, and the Caribbean), we are looking to unite and expand a network of researchers who wish to revisit and reconsider the ways that the emergent logic of commodity culture at the fin de siècle have shaped what we have come to understand as global modernism. This seminar touches upon recent scholarship in areas such as the environmental humanities, plantation studies, object-oriented ontology, nonhuman studies, food studies, and critical labour studies.
				</p>
				<p>Some of our motivating questions could include, but are not limited to: how can tracing the migration patterns of people through commodity culture be read alongside Modernist literature? How can the archives of companies, like Rowntree’s, Tate & Lyle, Tetley, and others, can be used to recontextualise modernist cultural production from a global perspective? How does the tea-off between Barry’s and Lyons emerge in modernist advertisements and (Irish) literature? How can migration and trading patterns be read alongside piracy and what place does this have in the rise of pirate literature? Can tracking the movement of objects, materials, resources, specific foodstuffs, fabrics, minerals, etc. be read palimpsestually in literature? etc.

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p7">The 1940s</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leader: Marius Hentea</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In the long tradition of reading modernism through the framework of the decade (the decadent 1890s, the avant-garde 1920s, the politicized 1930s), the 1940s is a conspicuous absence. Was there such a thing as 1940s literature? What was it? Is it possible to think of 1940s literature when the decade was, in effect, cut in two by the end of the war (for some) in 1945? This seminar seeks to understand the varieties of artistic and literary production within the 1940s, a decade that oscillated between the extremes of war and peace, revolution and retreat, destruction and reconstruction. The seminar hopes to expand the ambit of significant 1940s literary production beyond the long shadow of war literature or the generic category of ‘late modernism’. While seminal works have been written on 1940s print culture stalwarts like Horizon or Partisan Review, this seminar would also be keen to consider what the 1940s meant outside the Atlantic metropolitan framework (literary value and production in the context of nascent anti-colonial movements, Partition, American military occupations, Stalinization in Eastern Europe, international law and international institutions, etc.). Contributions on such topics as 1940s film, the academic study of modernism within the academy, the GI bill, ethnic literatures in America and elsewhere, literary-critical reevaluations like New Criticism, and global circulation of texts within the decade would also be welcome. The aim of the seminar is to rethink what the 1940s can look like as a ‘literary decade’. Does it make sense to conceptualize a category like 1940s literature? Or was that decade simply too capacious, too varied in its move from war to peace to cold war, to be contained within a single frame?

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p8">Imagining Cinema</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Hayley O’Malley and Jonathan Foltz</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In his book-length essay on film, The Devil Finds Work, James Baldwin recounts how going to the movies in the 1930s not only introduced him to the exhilarating (and mendacious) screen worlds of Hollywood cinema, but also opened up the wider possibilities of what he evocatively calls “the cinema of my mind”—the alternative aesthetics and narratives that he imagined could take place on screen. To explore those possibilities, Baldwin frequently turned to fiction, using literature to articulate and project new visions of film and film culture, from the highly interiorized scenes of film spectatorship in his novels Go Tell it On the Mountain and Another Country to his illustrated children’s book Little Man, Little Man, in which the young protagonist imagines his Harlem city block as a movie. In reclaiming the public act of spectatorship as a literary mode, Baldwin was not alone. Writers from the modernist period to the present have sought to rethink the formal and political possibilities of poetry and prose through acts of intermedial translation. From Gertrude Stein’s “films” and Federico García Lorca’s “screenplays” to the fiction of Kathleen Collins, writers have transformed the page into a “cinema of [the] mind,” recasting cinematic styles, repurposing cinematic practices, and proposing alternative systems of film production.

				</p>
				<p>This seminar looks to this rich history of imaginary cinema to ask a series of interlocking questions. What particular techniques, genres, and literary spaces have writers employed to imagine or reimagine the film medium, and what have been the aesthetic, social, and political stakes of those projects? If literary writers began writing with and against the movies as soon as they appeared, how might we periodize those practices, either in relation to the history of literary modernism or to the wider media histories in which it was embedded? In what ways have technological changes—from synch sound to the rise of television—impacted literary imaginations of cinema? And looking beyond the literary, what other imaginary cinemas can we find in mediums such as music, painting, and scrapbooking—practices that Pavle Levi calls “cinema by other means”—and how do those compare to their literary counterparts?

				</p>
				<p>Perhaps most importantly, this seminar asks participants to think methodologically about the utility of different approaches—e.g., historical, historicist, theoretical, materialist, speculative—for illuminating the ideas, practices, and stakes of imagined cinemas. Modernist studies has long been attuned to the dynamic interplay between literature and film (e.g., Laura Marcus, Susan McCabe, Charlene Regester, and Lara Fiegel), and new work in the field continues to make cross-arts entanglements a vital site for scholarly inquiry (e.g., Pardis Dabashi, Alix Beeston, and Sarah Gleeson-White). This seminar builds on that tradition within modernist studies by inviting collective dialogue about new sites for and approaches to thinking about literature and film together. Participants will be asked to write a short position paper (5-7 pages) or develop an alternative project (e.g., syllabus, video essay, digital mapping project).

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p9">Queer Kinship</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Elizabeth Blake and Aimee Armande Wilson</strong>
				</p>
				<p>“Queer theory has always been a theory of kinship,” argue Teagan Bradway and Elizabeth Freeman in Queer Kinship: Race, Sex, Belonging, Form (2022), noting further that these entwined theories “have much to contribute to ongoing debates about formalism and the politics of aesthetics.” The political extremes of the early twentieth century and the formal and aesthetic ideals of modernism make these debates particularly salient to modernist studies, and the inclusion of Freud, with his temporal and ideological links to modernism, in Bradway and Freeman’s list of “foundational texts of queer studies” invites further reflection on the role of queer kinship in modernist literature, history, and theory. We are particularly interested in papers that challenge the white, heteronormative principles through which kinship in modernism is often understood, and invite papers that consider modernist queerness in relation to topics such as:

				</p>
					<blockquote display="list-item">
						<li>Alternative forms of kinship, chosen family, and family abolition
						</li>
						<li>Interrupted kinship occasioned by birth control, abortion, miscarriage, infertility, impotence, murder, or warfare
						</li>
						<li>“Fictional kinship,” which refers to literary constructions of genealogy that rely on storytelling and the imagination to re-write biological kinship
						</li>
						<li>Kinship beyond the human
						</li>
						<li>The centrality of genealogical bloodlines to fascist, eugenicist, and white supremacist ideologies
						</li>
						<li>Marriage, divorce, and other domestic configurations, including Boston marriages, female husbands, and other queer and trans unions
						</li>
						<li>Representations of illegitimacy and bastardy

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p10">Modernism and its Neighborhoods</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Ria Banerjee and Anushka Sen</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Chicago, the location of this conference, is frequently described as a city of neighborhoods. This phrase signals the distribution of the city’s material structures as well as its affective knots of pride, belonging, and anxiety. This seminar not only confronts the political importance of neighborhoods, but also takes up modernist tools to trouble the idea of the neighborhood as a self-contained and knowable entity. The twentieth-century marks a view of the village or countryside as a space in crisis, and indeed in tense relationship to the metropolitan city. Zora Neale Hurston’s lively depictions of Eatonville on the one hand, and New York on the other, suggest the visible antagonisms between village and city (Hurston chose the village) do not necessarily imply a separation of worlds; rather, they are materially connected by flows of migration that continue in both directions. While such analyses effectively texture the spaces of the village or city as dynamic entities co-constituting each other, the smaller unit of the neighborhood sometimes remains under-theorized in its relationship to migration. There is abundant scholarship on modernist neighborhoods as networks such as the Harlem literati and Bloomsbury. However, we are interested in theorizing neighborhoods through a wider range of terms and ideas, in the hope that it will illuminate neglected dimensions of modernist migration, such as authors' relationship to gentrification, or the movement of unhoused people and animals.
				</p>
				<p>What exactly are modernism’s neighborhoods beyond overfamiliar spatial markers, and how do they survive, enact, as well as stifle migratory movement? We know of modernism’s scrutiny of the domestic interior and its fascination with the teeming cosmopolitan city, but does it engage seriously with the neighborhood’s ambiguous status between walls and sprawl?  Can a neighborhood be a community in the sense that so many alienated individuals crave in neoliberal times, or is it fated to gentrification and policing? What might modernism tell us?
The following topics, among others, are welcome:
				</p>
				<p>
					<blockquote display="list-item">
						<li>“Authenticity,” cosmopolitanism, and gentrification
						</li>
						<li>Housing, shelters, and neighborhood organizations
						</li>
						<li>Performing neighborhood politics
						</li>
						<li>Neighborhood tourism, voyeurism, and the exotic
						</li>
						<li>Neighborhoods in colonial or global south cities
						</li>
						<li>The ecology of neighborhoods
						</li>
						<li>Neighborhood rumors, gossip, fugitivity, and policing
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Format: Participants who sign up will be asked to first share their abstracts approximately a month before the conference, and then to submit a short paper by a deadline a week or two in advance of the conference dates. Everyone will be invited to read each other’s work ahead of time, but we will ask participants to focus on the papers in their particular group, which we will set up according to the abstracts.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the seminar itself, we plan to allot a few minutes for each group to present their experience of reading each other’s work. Once each group does so, we will collectively try to identify the patterns, stakes and most pressing questions that emerge from our projects, and collectively discuss them.

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p11">The Return to Character</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Robert Higney and Lisa Mendelman</strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Invited responders: Marta Filgerowicz and Swati Rana</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Modernism’s investments in character have a high-profile history, from E. M. Forster’s flat and round distinctions and Zora Neale Hurston’s analysis of the “characteristics” of Black art and expression, to Virginia Woolf’s transformation in human character “on or about December 1910.” Early twentieth-century culture featured a range of iconic figures, including the flapper, the dandy, the “it girl,” the New Negro and New Negro woman, the U.S. Filipino immigrant, the alcoholic, and the delinquent. Appropriately, character has become an increasingly salient term in modernist and twentieth-century scholarship, with a number of recent monographs and special issues on the topic (e.g. Amanda Anderson, Rita Felski, and Toril Moi’s Character [2019], Swati Rana’s Race Characters [2020], ASAP/J’s “The Character of Literary Criticism” [2021]). Our seminar extends these recent discussions, with a particular interest in the tensions that inhere in notions of both “modernism” and “character.”

				</p>
				<p>How does characterization work as a reading practice, a component of scholarly argument, and a key term in the history and theory of aesthetic forms? How does character engage with race, gender, sexuality, ability, and other aspects of embodied identity? How can literary critics attend to character’s valences across disciplines and media formats—from, say, film studies to literary studies to political theory? Where does character intersect with collective and nonhuman forms like networks, institutions, and infrastructure? What moral, ethical, and political traces does character retain in the contemporary academy, and what implicit and explicit roles has it played in ongoing critical debates?

				</p>We invite position papers that consider these or other questions. We are especially interested in approaches that elucidate how character bridges the social and formal, the individual and the collective, embodiment and abstraction—and those that, in Woolf’s words, might help us “to live a single year of life without disaster.”

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p12">New Work in Old Mags</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Adam McKible and Louise Kane</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Almost two decades since Sean Latham and Robert Scholes proclaimed the “rise of periodical studies,” a host of publications and collaborative initiatives have explored modernist magazines and periodicals through innovative approaches. From the use of digital humanities and computational methods, to international partnerships such as the Transnational Periodical Cultures (TPC) research group based at the University of Mainz, we find ourselves in a periodical renaissance in which plenty of projects continue to develop new ways of looking at old magazines.
				</p>
				<p>Tapping into the renewed energy of these efforts, this seminar invites participants to showcase work and projects that are performing ‘new work in old mags’. The scope of the seminar is broad and interdisciplinary. Participants may wish to share work that touches on (but is by no means limited to) the following questions, many of which may intersect and overlap:
				</p>
				<p><blockquote display="list-item">
						<li>genre: what makes a magazine ‘little’, ‘modernist’, or ‘mass’? What happens when we play with these definitions and the temporal and/or cultural stratifications they connote?
						</li>
						<li>language: applying translation studies or linguistic approaches to the study of mags
						</li>
						<li>magazines and visual culture: transverbal approaches to periodicals
						</li>
						<li>cultural/ national boundaries: projects that approach magazines as borderless or transnational
						</li>
						<li>magazines and media: how can we approach magazines in relation to other media forms?
						</li>
						<li>magazines and interdisciplinarity: what sort of methodologies, borrowed from other disciplines, offer new ways of understanding old texts?
						</li>
						<li>materiality and print culture: magazines as circulating objects, physically produced constructions
						</li>
						<li>magazines and digitization/ archives: projects that create magazine repositories, the ‘magazine’ as etymological storehouse
						</li>
						<li>periodical studies and doubt: the ‘fall’ of periodical studies, how ‘old mags’ present biased/inaccurate accounts of historical events, problematic periodicals
						</li>
						<li>We particularly welcome participants who may be part of collaborative approaches to the study of magazines.
						</li>

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Alexander Hartley, Gasira Timir, and Jesse McCarthy</strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Invited participant: Jesse McCarthy</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In the stories writers and critics tell about the forward motion of literary creativity, two terms have loomed large since the era of high modernism: the breakdown and the breakthrough. Breakdown has been a preferred term for the turn to the self, the exposition of shattered subjectivity, the Freudian excavation of the individual unconscious. Breakthrough, conversely, has been associated with the turn to the collective, the assertion of a political imperative, and the Marxian commitment to revealing and changing the fabric of social life.

				</p>
				<p>American lyric poetry at midcentury provides paradigmatic examples of both. A moment of breakdown is Robert Lowell’s ‘confessional’ turn in Life Studies (1959), culminating in his lyric speaker’s exclamation that “my mind’s not right”. A model of breakthrough, by contrast, is found in the newfound Black nationalism of Gwendolyn Brooks’s In the Mecca (1968), with its closing exhortation to “Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind.”
				</p>
				<p>The relevance of these ‘breaks’ is not confined to any one period and has not ebbed. Contemporary theorists continue to rely on the idea of ‘breakdown’ to characterise racial capitalism today—take, for example, Anna Kornbluh’s discussion of the breakdown of mediation as a central feature of “too late” capitalist life in Immediacy (2024); or alternatively, Fred Moten’s characterisation of the aesthetics of the Black radical tradition in In the Break (2003).

				</p>
				<p>For this seminar, we invite short, propositional papers (5–7 pages) that engage “the breakdown” and/or “the breakthrough” as central topoi. Topics addressed might include any of the aforementioned, from American lyric poetry at midcentury to the Black Arts Movement, the Black Radical tradition, and/or the negation of mediation; alternatively, they might address topics such as: accelerationism and/or accelerationist anxieties; environmental degradation/activism; the psychoanalytic revival; or any other sites of breakdown/breakthrough.

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Sarah Coogan and Romana Huk</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In her 2021 contribution to Douglas Mao’s edited volume addressing The New Modernist Studies, Susan Stanford Friedman asserts the need for new comparative and interdisciplinary methodologies in addressing the relationship between religion and global modernism. While, as Friedman notes, a robust conversation has emerged in recent years surrounding the role of religion in Anglo-American modernism—and in some cases engaging a broader geographical context—much work remains to be done at the intersection of postsecular and postcolonial readings of modernity and modernism(s).
				</p>
				<p>This panel proposes to foster conversation around that significant intersection. Papers might consider: what religion means in a modernist context; the roles narratives of secularization and postsecularism play in modernist studies; the relationship between religion and literary form; and the relationships between religion and colonialism in modernist writing, among many other subjects. We hope that participants will consider both how new methodological approaches to religion might refine our understanding of global modernism, and how modernist writing might illuminate developments in religious studies.

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Caroline Zoe Krzakowski and Paula Derdiger</strong>
				</p>
				<p>War generated some of the most legible migrations that characterize the modernist period. The First and Second World Wars, the Spanish Civil War, the second Sino-Japanese War, and the emerging Cold War involved large-scale movements of military personnel and diplomats, spies, prisoners of war, Holocaust victims, ghetto and internment camp victims, refugees, émigrés, and evacuees.
				</p>
				<p>War also changed the way culture and information traveled across borders and throughout expanding and shifting networks.. Many writers, artists, filmmakers, and journalists migrated as they responded to the exigencies of wartime life – as artists, workers, and citizens. The highly mobile, globalizing realities of modern warfare prompt special attention to the significance of borders and thresholds of all kinds within the modernist period, from the politically constituted borders defining nation states and empires to the physical and terrestrial boundaries within built, infrastructural, and natural environments.
				</p>
				<p>We invite participants who are eager to think through the significance of wartime migration and mobility for modernist studies across the geographic, formal, and disciplinary spectrum.

				</p>
				<p>Potential paper subjects include but are not limited to:
					<blockquote display="list-item">
						<li>Migrations across formal, disciplinary, or medial boundaries within particular texts or within a group of related texts that reckon with war;
						</li>
						<li>Representations of migration or mobility related to warfare and wartime conditions in literature, visual art, film, performance, or radio;

						</li>
						<li>Cultural artifacts and technologies that are central to the history of wartime migration, such as maps, trains, ships, airplanes, transportation networks, communication technologies, camps, bunkers, bomb shelters;

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p16">Modernism and the Therapeutic Imaginary</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Christian Gelder and Vidya Venkatesh</strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Invited Participants: Beth Blum and Kevin Duong</strong>
				</p>
				<p>The turn of the twentieth century witnessed the emergence of a diverse therapeutic imaginary. Alongside Freud’s well-known attempts to liberate desire, the early years of the century also saw the creation of a new set of psychopathologies, the proliferation of a series of therapeutic techniques, and the beginnings of several psychotherapeutic and psychiatric traditions. This period witnessed the explosion of discourses about doctoring, diagnosing and healing, which were accompanied by a range of medicalised accounts of the mind, its sicknesses and capacities for recovery. But the therapeutic imaginary also carried with it a host of often disturbing political questions about the relationship between private psychology and social organization, about mental health and race, and the politics of childhood, adulthood, partnership and procreation. As the rise of urban mass culture increasingly motivated large-scale statistical approaches to human life, the therapeutic imaginary, in all its guises, began to interrogate the possibility of a ‘healthy, happy and efficient’ population, to cite Adolf Meyer’s phrase – one both in keeping and in contradiction with capitalist modernity.

				</p>
				<p>The purpose of this seminar is to explore the connections between modernism and the therapeutic imaginary. How did modernist literature respond to the rise of therapy? How did literary narrative either confirm or resist psychotherapeutic diagnostics? How was the clinical encounter represented in literary writing, and how was literary writing represented in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic medicine? What is the relationship between literature and therapeutic advice? Looking beyond the well-established tendency in modernist literature to theorize consciousness and the mind, how might we read modernist authors as theorists of the (psycho)therapeutic in particular? And finally, what role did literature play in confirming or resisting the politics associated with this imaginary? This seminar invites contributors to respond to these questions or to examine other aspects of modernism’s engagement with therapy.

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leader: Agnes Malinowska</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In this seminar, we investigate how recent theoretical developments in queer and trans theory may impact the way we teach, write, and think about gender and sexuality in the cultural and social spaces of modernism and modernity (broadly and globally construed).
				</p>
				<p>Topics of interest include:
					<blockquote display="list-item">
						<li>How ideas and methods associated with the “temporal turn” in queer theory encourage us to reconsider well-known modernist investments around time, affect, identity, and style
						</li>
						<li>How queer of color critique can help us  analyze modernist social formations as situated at the intersection of race, gender, sexuality and class—and likewise evaluate how these formations track or diverge from hegemonic and oppressive nationalist ideals and practices
						</li>
						<li>How queer theoretical investments in the wayward, the sideways, the non-linear, non-identitarian, anti-social, and utopian invite us to reimagine modernist accounts of exile, migration, and displacement
						</li>
						<li>How recent historical excavations of queer and trans sexuality and identity re-orient the locations and meanings of “modernity” in gender and sexuality studies. What, for instance, does “modernity” mean for the trans subject (in light of the history of trans medicine)? How might histories of sexual scientific thought ask us to reevaluate modernist sex and gender taxonomies?
						</li>
						<li>How work in biopolitical and necropolitical studies centered on gender and sexuality can help make sense of the modernist management of queer lives and populations
						</li>
						<li>How theories of queer performance and performativity encourage new narratives around the production of modernist identity formations, popular forms of gender display, the circulation of queer affect, and embodied social experience most broadly
						</li>
						<li>How cultural producers working in tandem with developments in gender and sexuality studies—for instance, Black filmmakers associated with the New Queer Cinema movement—have sought to imagine or in some sense recover “queer modernist” lives and scenes that are shrouded in archival silence or apparently lost to history
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The seminar welcomes participants invested in teaching, thinking, or writing about any aspect of modernist cultural, social, and aesthetic production or history. Participants interested in cultural objects and scenes that live on the global, political, racial, and economic margins of “queer modernism” are especially encouraged to join. This seminar seeks to include a diverse range of scholars across professional statuses and institutional affiliations.

				</p>
				<p>Each participant will write a brief and informal position paper (~5 pages) that is pre-circulated and read by all participants prior to the conference. The seminar welcomes reflections on pedagogy, scholarship, or some combination of both.

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Joel Rhone and Chris Gortmaker</strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Invited participants: Peter Kalliney and Lisa Siraganian</strong>
				</p>
				
				<p>Literary modernism is a story of distinctions and linkages, exclusions and essences. From T.S. Eliot’s tradition of impersonality, Henry James’s “competition with life,” and Virginia Woolf’s “character in itself” to formalist engagements with race in Du Bois’s Souls of Black Folk, Jean Toomer’s Cane, and Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises, modernism’s critical definitions and artistic creations stake out essences in terms of form, period, place, and ascriptive identity. To map and evaluate the role of essentialist argument in modernist studies, this seminar is organized around two interrelated questions: Should the study of modernism necessarily involve arguments about what counts as a modernist artwork or discourse? How do we balance the explanatory power of essentialist arguments with the exclusions they necessitate?
				</p>
				<p>Further questions for thinking through research methods and pedagogical practices include: What essentialist or anti-essentialist arguments about modernism do you find to be an analytic aid or impediment in your research or, more broadly, in modernist studies as a field? How can historical periodization inform—or not inform—the ways we explain what modernism is? How should we relate the formal or thematic essence of a work—that which may or may not make it modernist—to the ascriptive identity of its author? How should we relate the historically variable politics of modernist artworks to the inclusive/exclusive politics of modernism as a canon?

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Mia Cecily Florin-Sefton and Naomi Michalowicz</strong>
				</p>
				<p>What does the study of modernism and modernist experimentation offer histories of data, data visualization, and information science? To date, literary histories of modernism have prioritized the particular, the unrepresentable, and the ineffable, in contrast to a preoccupation with “type” and statistical average in Victorian realism. Yet the historical period called modernism coincides directly with widespread innovation in methods of social quantification, and what Khalil Muhammad calls “a total revolution in racial data generating technologies.” Indeed, numerous Black and working-class “modernist” authors—George Schuyler, W. E. B. Du Bois, Upton Sinclair, Gertrude Stein, Ann Petry, Jean Toomer, among others—were entirely preoccupied with the relationship between “statistics and storytelling” (Du Bois). Moreover, the sudden emergence of new data regimes in the early 20th century gave rise to an existential crisis of representation which is, we propose, quintessentially modernist in nature. In light of this claim, we invite papers that explore the relationship between modernist aesthetic innovation and forms of data visualization, data science, data story-telling, modernist plot and data plotting, and the history of the “data” concept.

			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Daniel Raschke and Edward P. Dallis Comentale</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This seminar invites participants to ponder on modernity's distinctive discourse networks as they start to migrate, morph, and malfunction during the modernist period and beyond.
				</p>
				<p>Friedrich Kittler's dictum, “Media determine our situation,” sets up a version of modernity continually reconfigured by cultural institutions, bodies of knowledge, transmission concerns, and technological a priori. Per Kittler, in 1800 discourse is shaped by a romantic-classical ethos of subjective intentionality and intimacy, while in 1900, it is produced by random generators, storage devices, and transmission networks with ever more minute and indiscriminate capacities. As a seminar, we hope to map and debate the trajectories of the discourse networks manifesting around the year 2000.
				</p>
				<p>Kittler was interested in dismantling hegemonic institutions and, like Walter Benjamin, he was particularly attentive to those breaks and disjunctures, historical offshoots, most often brought on by malfunctioning or radically misused technologies. Nietzsche wrote “Our writing tools shape our thoughts” finding joy experimenting with his typewriter in the face of disability. Derrida, fond of his Apple Macintosh, once reluctantly admitted that there could be no deconstruction without computers. However, as Balsamo famously observes, information technologies have veiled gendered and racialized undercurrents as both “typewriters” and “computers” were once synonymous with female clerical workers.
				</p>
				<p>Writers, artists, and thinkers from across the globe vehemently resist and meditate on hegemonic technological infrastructures. This seminar invites participants to explore and conceptualize the agents, circuits, and components of discourse networks disrupting and glitching media and information technologies. In particular, we invite participants to consider the mediation and processing of modernist concerns in terms of forms, interfaces, and agency.
				</p>
				<p>Potential inquiries include: What forms might novel discourse networks take? Will they be discerned on the printed page and in the overturning of various literary cults? Or within rectangular windows interfaces and the constant tapping of digital exchange?

		<summary class="seminar-title" id="p21">American Expats & European Sirens</summary>
			<div class="description">
				<p><strong>Leaders: Clément Oudart and Charlotte Estrade</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This seminar seeks to analyze a very specific mode of migration: expatriation. As opposed to the collective nature of migration, expatriation may be seen as an individual form of migration. Whether chosen or endured, for a short or a long span of time, expatriation has been chosen by many modernist writers and artists, from Gertrude Stein and Edith Wharton to T.S. Eliot and H.D., who settled permanently in France or in England. Relocation has shaped the life of countless modernists.
				</p>
				<p>To what extent does expatriation offer a decentered frame of analysis or a distanced perception of the US and American identity? How does the length of people’s stay overseas contribute to the shaping of their work, be it poetry, fiction, drama or other, more hybrid generic forms? Indeed, one should make a distinction between writers whose expatriation was definitive (T.S. Eliot or H.D. offer a case in point) and those for whom expatriation took multiple stages (e.g. Mina Loy, Claude McKay, Ezra Pound). For many, expatriation was a temporary yet memorable stage of their career: for Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, ee cummings, Langston Hughes, or F. Scott Fitzgerald, expatriation(s) constituted formative moments, both personally and artistically. In contrast, one may also consider their choice in light of those Americans who notably resisted moving to Europe, such as William Carlos Williams (who had studied in Geneva and Paris) and William Faulkner.
				</p>
				<p>This seminar will explore the stakes of American transatlantic expatriation namely in relation with migration, exile, networks, communities, colonies, racism, xenophobia, homesickness, tourism, cosmopolitanism, international modernism, individual and collective transnational experience.

<h2><strong>Modernist Historiographies</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p>How and why do we write histories of modernism, today?</p>

<p></p>

<p>The expansive energies of modernist studies increasingly
inspire scholars to become cultural historiographers of events, phenomena,
institutions, and durations beyond the field’s privileged frames. Scholars of
modernism write interdisciplinary histories of global networks and markets;
diverse readerships and publics; political movements and resistances;
environmental crises and imagined futures; specific localities, vast
geographical expanses, and the many modes of moving around and between them.
Though far from exhaustive, this list both speaks to the wide reach of
modernist historiography and prompts urgent questions about its methods,
motivations, and persistent exclusions. This seminar accordingly asks: how does
or can modernist studies open onto neglected or lost histories? How can new
models of creative, reparative, or speculative engagement with archival materials
and traces push the field in new and critically inclusive directions? What are
the lingering effects of the historiographic forms—e.g., Euro-American,
hierarchical, militaristic—that shaped the field as it was institutionalized in
the mid-twentieth century? What are the historiographic forms of global or
plural modernisms, now?</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar invites papers that address—at any scale—the
historiographic dimensions or potentialities of modernist studies. We welcome
papers grappling with the process of writing or recovering modernist histories
alongside conceptual papers about the writing of histories of, and outside of,
modernism.</p>

<h2><strong>Unruly Movement</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Leaders:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>John Alba Cutler, Northwestern University</p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Harris Feinsod, Northwestern University</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar will consider patterns and instances of human
movement that do not fit the familiar narrative parameters of migration,
particularly liberal narratives of migration that understand it as a response
to opportunity and an essential feature of the putatively multicultural, modern
nation state. In and around the Great Migration, for example, were many forced
movements, including the drift of Native Americans to urban centers during the
Allotment Era; the displacement of Filipinos after the Philippine-American War;
the forced repatriation of Mexicans (and Mexican Americans) in the 1930s; the
post-WWI statelessness of a variety of European refugees; and Japanese
internment in the United States, to name only a few. These forms of human
movement pressure narratives of migration in at least two ways. First, they
foreclose the temptation to equate movement simply with disruption, and hence,
political resistance. When does abiding become a form of unruly response to the
state? What vocabulary do we have to describe movement initiated by state
violence? Second, they invite us to find ways that individuals and groups have
adapted, innovated, and creatively reimagined the significance of forced
movements. What aesthetic resources have marginalized and minoritized groups had
recourse to in repurposing or taking control of the significance of their
movement, even (or especially) when that movement is forced? We welcome papers
that consider particular examples of human movement as well as papers that
theorize political, social, and aesthetic features of unruly movement.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Amongst the migrants shaping modernist landscapes were
individuals moving across the borders of gender. While the histories, cultural
productions, and representations of such communities are often addressed under
the rubric of “queer modernism,” others have argued that a transgender analytic
is necessary to apprehend the role of gender nonconformity in modernism and
modernity. Some have asserted that fictional trans figures—e.g., Woolf’s
Orlando—played a central role in establishing modernist aesthetics and
dismantling conventional notions of gender. Others, like Emma Heaney, assert
that such readings rely too heavily on queer theory’s tendency to erase trans
materiality, allegorizing the trans subject as an overdetermined symbol of
transgression. In <i>The New Woman,</i> Heaney argues for distinguishing
between “expert” definitions of trans femininity and “vernacular” notions that
emerge from the cultural practices and productions of “fairies, mollies, and
Maryannes” (9). Others, following Jessica Berman, have examined the conceptual
resonances that exist between the “trans” in transgender and the “trans” in
transnational. Additionally, scholars such as Chris Coffman have used
transgender theory to reconsider the gender expressions of queer modernist
figures such as Gertrude Stein.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar invites scholars to reflect on extant
approaches to trans topics within modernist studies, investigate methodological
conundrums, and propose paths forward. Seminar participants will submit
position papers of 5-7 pages, which will be circulated in advance. The two-hour
seminar will be broken into thirds. In the first block, participants will
assess the current state of trans approaches to modernist studies. The middle
third will be devoted to addressing potential problems in considering modernist
objects from a trans perspective, with special consideration to frictions that
exist between trans studies and queer studies. In the remaining third,
participants will propose possible futures for trans modernist studies. This
seminar aims to foster thoughtful new contributions to the study of trans
modernisms.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Antifascism? Politicizing Art in the Twentieth
and Twenty-First Centuries</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Leaders:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Brandon Truett, University of Chicago</p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Miguel Caballero, Northwestern University</p>

<p></p>

<p>In recent years, fascism has reemerged as the site of
widespread discussion due in part to the circulation and influence of rightwing
ideologies across the world (Trumpism, Brexit, Duterte in the Philippines,
Bolsonaro in Brazil, Le Pen in France, Vox in Spain, etc.). In contrast, as the
historian Michael Seidman argued in his 2017 book <i>Transatlantic
Antifascisms,</i> “antifascism has received little attention,” despite being “perhaps
the most powerful Western ideology of the twentieth century.” As Seidman and
many other scholars have pointed out, the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) was the
moment in which antifascism crystallized as an international concern. In 1972,
Michel Foucault framed Deleuze and Guattari’s <i>Anti-Oedipus</i> as “an
Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life … an art of living counter to all forms of
fascism.” Indeed, antifascism or nonfascism has seemed to signify any political
movement that resists what is perceived as fascist, thus amplifying uses of
both terms while risking their historical specificity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar invites papers from scholars working on
antifascism and its relationship to art and literature in any national or
cultural context. Following Emilio Gentile’s debate on the scope of fascism, we
seek to discuss whether antifascism is an ideology constrained to a specific
historical period and/or a political disposition transcending time.
Specifically, we are interested in exploring how these definitions affect our
understanding of the works of art and literature that have been animated by, or
presented through, antifascism. We ask that participants also address the
following conceptual questions: What does it mean to describe a work of
artistic expression as antifacist? What is the relationship between artmaking
and antifascist activism? How has the concept of antifascism migrated across a
global range of contexts in which people use art to resist myriad forms of
fascist aggression (racism, settler colonialism, nativism, sexism, homophobia,
transphobia)?</p>

<h2><strong>Transracial Circuits, Transnational Modernism</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Invited participants:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Jennifer Fleissner, Indiana University</p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Kevin Quashie, Brown University</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nella Larsen saw Gertrude Stein’s <i>Three Lives</i> as a
powerful meditation on Black experiences, and had “Melanctha” in mind as she
wrote <i>Quicksand.</i> Langston Hughes revisits Poundian imagism in poems such
as “Chord” and “Subway Rush Hour”—the latter a direct response to “In a Station
of the Metro,” pushing the principle of condensation further than ever, and
assigning races—and racial connections—to Pound’s “faces.” Wallace Thurman and
Richard Bruce Nugent found themselves moved by James Joyce’s <i>Ulysses,</i>
which offered a compelling connection between the Celtic Revival and the New
Negro movement, as well as their own ambivalence to Harlem’s
institutionalization. Like Stein, Pound, and Joyce, these authors were unafraid
to critique the very terms of their work’s legibility. What could be more
avant-garde?</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar takes its cue from Jahan Ramazani, who has
argued that disciplinary boundaries tend to obscure the complex networks and
cultural overlap of a transnational poetics. This is particularly true for
modernism’s Black writers. The problematic appropriation of Blackness as “primitivism”
by largely white European and American artists has been well documented. What
has yet to be fully explored, however, is the extent to which Black modernist
writers saw themselves reflected in, and contributed to, the larger currents of
the period: questions of shock and rupture, alienation and homelessness, the
fragmentation of consciousness, the disparity between the seen and the felt.
Participants will consider how formal experimentation migrated in both
directions across national and racial borders—as foundational in <i>Passing</i>
as in <i>To the Lighthouse,</i> in <i>Infants of the Spring</i> as in <i>Finnegans
Wake</i>—in order to become what we know it as today. As our world grapples
with widespread anti-Black racism, modernist studies must consider how Black artists
of the period have suffered from the move to adjectival pigeonholing,
preventing a fuller appreciation of their rich contributions to modernist
aesthetics. </p>

<h2><strong>Poetics Without Modernism</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Leaders:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Ben Glaser, Yale University</p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Erin Kappeler, Tulane University </p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar asks how we might re-theorize poetry and
poetics from the late-nineteenth century through the present by deprioritizing
modernism, the modern, and modernist form as conceptual categories. We invite
papers that explore the following (and related) questions: To what extent do
narratives of formal innovation and rupture continue to structure studies of
poetry? How might these narratives foreclose other histories and other
paradigms for the study of poetry and poetics? How are recent conversations
about the new lyric studies, historical poetics, new formalisms, and
transnational modernisms changing the way we talk about poetic form? We invite
papers that take up the many possible approaches to poetry and poetics that
bracket concepts of “modern poetry” and “modern form” in the pursuit of
literary historical knowledge.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We are interested in exploring the complexities of thinking
without or around modernism right now, in 2021, in light of modernist studies’
increasing recognition of Indigenous and transnational perspectives as they
challenge standard literary historical and geopolitical periodization. We
propose this discussion, furthermore, in response to the near-total absence of
open tenure-line positions in modernist studies in the United States academy.
If there are pressing historical, theoretical, ethical, and institutional
reasons to reimagine modernist studies again, what can poetry and poetics teach
us about what the new new modernist studies might look like?</p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Michael Rubenstein, Stony Brook University </p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Justin Neuman, The New School</p>

<p></p>

<p>How does thinking about modernism through the concept of
environment expand, critique, and reconfigure what we’ve come to know as the
modernist canon? What are the key differences between modernist understandings
of the environment and those of their predecessors and inheritors? What can we
learn from the moderns about the environment that may be obscured by our own
thinking about the concept and the realities it attempts to describe? What does
it mean to rethink modernism under the banner of environmentalism and/or
ecocriticism? </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the spirit of their recent book, <i>Modernism and Its
Environments</i> (Bloomsbury, 2020), the seminar conveners seek new research on
a wide range of modernist environments, including wild spaces, industrial
wastelands, urban ecologies, and colonial extraction sites, from scholars
interested in both the green and the gritty manifestations of the modernist
environmental imagination.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We solicit papers that explore the ecological, social,
scientific, technological, and political transformations that marked the
beginning, middle, and end of the modernist period, and that may even suggest a
redefinition of modernism itself.</p>

<p>Scholarship in queer modernist studies has recently turned
its attention to misfits, perverts, eccentrics, and other forms of sexuality
that fall outside available categories. Examining these defunct, inchoate,
vestigial, and other non-normative organizations of eros and sexuality, this
seminar strives to understand the encounter between individual modernist
subjects and the increasing calcification of the hetero/homo binary. We’re
interested in exploring the archives of these non-fitting lives, the
vocabularies, affects, texts, sites, and practices through which individuals
construct misfit sexualities. How do misfits negotiate, dispute, dodge, and
experience historical shifts in sexuality? What existing discourses or older
styles of subjectivity provide resources for fashioning nonce sexualities and
their erotic repertoires? Do modernist aesthetic practices and literary forms
provide affordances for the construction of these alternative sexualities? How
do modes of eccentricity illuminate dominant categories and help us to
understand sexuality’s taxonomic construction and also its imbrication with the
colonial and racial taxonomic projects of the era? What attention is needed to
what happens at discursive interstices, to palimpsestic effects, to effects of
translation and poly-languaging, to willful or unwilled silences? Building on a
wave of scholarship in queer of color critique, we will explore the relation
between these sexually inchoate or unyarded subjects and processes of
racialization to ask how sexuality is reconfigured when flesh rather than
subjectivity becomes its anchor. How might these subjectivities record or
engage historical events or how might they themselves be historical? Are these
sexual subjectivities or erotic practitioners unique or do they coagulate into
sexual subcultures or affective sodalities? In what ways are they constructed
through logics of gender, class, age, religion, and other axes of difference?
We will open by having the discussion leaders trace themes and intellectual
through lines among the papers for 10 minutes each and then move to a general
discussion.</p>

<h2><strong>Surrealism on the Move</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Leader:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Chris Townsend, Royal Holloway, University of London</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar explores the significance of migration and
exile upon the creativity of surrealist artists and especially upon the
evolution of the movement in the 1930s and ’40s away from the conceptual
premises established in Paris under the aegis of André Breton. If surrealism
begins as a relatively staid affair in the salons of Paris in the 1920s, with
its movement limited to the urban dérive, by the 1930s it is an art of
continental and global wanderers. Whether it is in the trans-Atlantic movement
of European artists such as Leonora Carrington, South Americans such as Leonor
Fini, or Breton himself, under the pressure of war, to the USA and Mexico; the
permanent, yet unstable European settlement of an American artist such as Lee
Miller; or the trans-European journeys of the British poet and painter Roland
Penrose, “wandering” and resettlement will be crucial for the long-term
development of surrealism.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar seeks contributions that map these movements
and explore their impact, with particular attention to artists already on the
margins of surrealism because of gender and/or ethnicity, who redefine their
practice as a consequence of trans-national and continental migration. What are
the implications of new languages and social practices? Of new networks of
friendship, and the transformation of old ones by distance? Of new sites and
modes of publication and exhibition? Do these changed conditions allow us to
re-map Surrealism as a whole?</p>

<h2><strong>In These Times: Activism, Labor, Modernism</strong></h2>

<p>The <i>Modernism/modernity </i>Print Plus blog series “In
These Times” is rooted in Chicago; it takes its name from the progressive
monthly founded there as a broadsheet in 1976. In its celebration of Chicago’s
modernist vibrancy, the MSA conference CFP leaves out the city’s radical
tradition, its identification with the struggles of labor, its identity as “‘Hog
Butcher … Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat.” How might similar occlusions and their
redress, this seminar asks, inform our own activisms in the present, inside the
classroom and out? How do conditions of precarity, contingency, and alienation
blunt solidarity within and beyond the institutional silos of the contemporary
university? In the spirit of the “In These Times” column, we invite position
papers that respond to its initial prompt, now even more urgent in these times
of academic disaster capitalism: “How can we insert the urgency of activism
into our models of composition? We know how, if we didn’t earlier, to express
this urgency as private citizens—march, volunteer, protest, get local,
organize, call, write, share information, support each other, engage, engage,
engage. But how do we as <i>scholars of modernism and modernity </i>do so?” </p>

<h2><strong>War &amp; Interiority</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p>The violence of war is
outward-facing, directed against other factions or nations. But this aggression
emerges from within individual subjects, and is a manifestation of deeply held
values, pervasive emotions, and foundational memories. This interiority drives
all participants, from the reticent to reviled warmongers: in <i>Mein Kampf</i>,
Hitler recounts how his childhood experience of reading his father’s histories
of the Franco-Prussian War ensured that the “heroic struggle” for German identity
would “become [his] greatest inner experience.”</p>

<p>In the aftermath of war, internalized processes and
ideologies make sense of loss. In <i>The Great War and Modern Memory</i>, Paul
Fussell describes how one D-Day veteran focused “‘the inner recording eye … on
phenomena that the mind would be able to live with in the future.’” In the
aftermath of World War I, modernist poets turned that inner recording eye on
the grief-stricken subject: in “Paris,” Hope Mirrlees’s <i>flâneuse</i> wanders
through a city in mourning as the Treaty of Versailles is negotiated. At the
same time, traversing the same streets, Vicente Huidobro embarks upon <i>Altazor</i>,
an epic poem lamenting the post-war “painful grammar walk[ing] through [the]
brain.”</p>

<p>For Sarah Cole, modernist literary violence is either
broadly representative or “private, subjective, and personal.” Focusing on
these latter manifestations, this seminar will engage with the blurring of
these two categories, as in Eliot’s “[u]ndisciplined squads of emotion.”
Similarly, we might consider how wartime fiction of the 1930s and 1940s turns
away from Freudian inwardness toward surface and detachment, as explored in
Maud Ellmann’s current research. Collective interiorities could prove another
preoccupation, as in the affective aims of propaganda. War might trigger
recollections of past trauma, or, as in Amy Lowell’s “September, 1918,” it may
foster utopian visions of a warless future when there will be no need “to
balance” the self-conscious self “Upon a broken world.”</p>

<p>Should this conversation prove generative, organizers will
consider collecting contributions for a journal special issue. </p>

<p>This seminar asks of modernism: how did it attempt to
intervene in the world? In “Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown,” Virginia Woolf notes
that a work of great literature should be complete in itself, and should not
make a reader feel she needs to <i>do </i>something after reading it, such as
join a society or write a check. But what if the point of literature is,
specifically, to activate the reader to do something, including taking
political action? Can we discern, either in modernism, adjacent to it, or as a
separate literary ideal altogether, the project of activating and intervening,
making changes in the present, and reshaping the direction of the future? Or,
to take another tack, how might literature be put into action by other forces,
perhaps beyond the author’s intention? For this seminar, I invite papers—feel
free to think of them as provocations and thought experiments—that take up the
prospect of an activist literary project. Participants might consider writers
who aim for their work to propel some larger goal, even to the place of utopia,
or might look in a less author-focused way at how literature can be enlisted to
broader purposes, or may consider more collective models of literary action.
Any genre of literature from anywhere in the world is welcome for
consideration, and topics might include gender, race, geopolitics, empire,
ecology/climate, economics, war, migration (the conference theme), or other
areas where literary culture might be imagined, or even asked, to provoke
change. </p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar considers
innovative approaches to teaching about the First World War and its continued
historical relevance in the context of never-ending wars, technologies of
destruction, pandemics, collective trauma, and militaristic masculinities.
Participants are invited to share ideas for designing and teaching courses that
put diverse materials into conversation and encourage students to participate
in rethinking the war’s historical and contemporary import. Particular
attention will be given to expanding WWI studies beyond the familiar texts,
figures, myths, and tropes. Participants may want to share strategies for 1)
crafting syllabi and assignments that challenge or expand familiar narratives
about the war and include perspectives often excluded from history; 2)
promoting critical thinking about historical and aesthetic issues surrounding
violence and its representations; 3) or bringing theoretical perspectives from
trauma theory, disability studies, queer studies, race theory, or postcolonial
studies to bear on WWI literature, art, and history. In addition, participants’
papers might illustrate how they teach a particular work or cluster of works;
how they combine literary, visual, and historical material into units; how they
engage students in archival research and/or digital projects; what sorts of
successful assignments they have developed; and/or what sorts of resources they
utilize. Ideas for making WWI courses fruitfully interdisciplinary—combining
history, literature, art, film, and popular culture—will be discussed, as will
innovative ways of relating WWI topics to contemporary culture and politics in
order to help students understand the war’s continuing significance.
Collaborative, disruptive, experiential, creative, online, and student-centered
pedagogies will also be of interest. Both novice and experienced teachers are
welcome.</p>

<p>The format of the seminar will entail a short
introduction to the topic by the organizer, followed by brief (10-12 minute)
presentations by two invited participants who will detail specifics of how they
approach teaching about WWI in their courses and how their research informs
those courses. These introductory comments will be followed by feedback on
submitted essays in groups of 3, and then a general exchange of ideas involving
the whole seminar group.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the migration of the novel to Brazil in the
nineteenth century, Roberto Schwarz notes that “the unification of the
novelistic sphere with that of reality comes about through their almost total
separation, and the dialectic of the two work through their precise
articulation, and not, as usually happens, through some kind of conflation.”
Writing in the 1970s, Schwarz here revisited a problematic that proved just as
central to modernism and its migration to the peripheries: namely the artwork’s
relationship to the world and to its audience; or, more precisely, how the
artwork’s form refuses its reducibility to either. This claim is a resolutely
aesthetic concern, but one conceived as vital not just to efforts to understand
how forms travel across cultures and time periods, but also to imagining and
interpreting the unequal relations that have long characterized the development
of the world system as a whole. More recently, criticism and theory associated
with the new materialisms and the decolonial turn have extended discussions
about center and periphery into new directions. How might these approaches
rewrite the histories of modernism and its migration to the global south?
Importantly, where the dialectical tradition to which Schwarz contributes
insists on the separation between artwork and world, such approaches discover
new possibilities—critical, political, and aesthetic—in the critique of that
separation. This seminar considers what these recent turns in criticism and
theory have meant for our understanding of modernism’s relationship to the
global south, and what they might tell us about the artwork’s relationship to
the inequalities of the world system more generally. What are the limits of
these critical turns? And how might the Schwarzian insistence on separation
offer a means to think beyond them?</p>

<h2><strong>Rural Modernisms</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Leader:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>Zachary Rockwell Ludington, University of Maine</p>

<p></p>

<p>The industrial city is a key element in the story of
modernism, but the modern city necessarily develops in contrast to other spaces
and temporalities. Automobiles, aviation, rail, telegraph, telephone, and steam
technology collapse distance and create new relationships between metropolitan
centers; between cities and non-urban spaces; between individuals and the scope
of their world. From the Baudelairean <i>flâneur</i>’s cultivated detachment to
the revolutionary politics of Mexican <i>estridentismo</i>, the modern urbanite’s
attitudes take shape in opposition to fading imaginaries of the old city and in
dialog with non-urban spaces and the mythologies built around them, like the
wilderness, the farm, the village, or colonial spaces. These spaces and
temporal frames of mind are in flux at the beginning of the twentieth century,
producing not a single urbanized modern consciousness but a multiplicity of ways
of being modern: urban, rural, or otherwise. It follows, in Susan Stanford
Friedman’s crisp formulation, that “multiple modernities create multiple
modernisms. Multiple modernisms require respatializing and thus reperiodizing
modernism.” Scholars have taken up this work in recent years, reading modernism
in post-independence Cuba, rural England, or colonial India vis-à-vis modernity’s
shifting notions of time and space. This seminar seeks to convene scholars
working in various rural modernisms to find points of theoretical and aesthetic
convergence and, indeed, divergence. The conversation will cross linguistic,
political, and disciplinary boundaries, and highlight patterns of migration,
communication, and transnational exchange evident in modernist work that
engages with rural spaces.</p>

<h2><strong>Modernism and “the Whiteness problem”: Filling Gaps,
Identifying Investments </strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Leaders:</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>The phrase “the Whiteness problem” ironically invokes
earlier designations “the woman problem” and “the Negro problem” to suggest
both distinctions and relationships among attempts to source a social issue in
a singular identity feature. And yet Anglophone literary modernist studies,
despite scholarship redressing silences around race and colonialism, remains
grounded in a largely unmarked norm designated “whiteness.” This is a problem.
The 2021 MSA seminar on whiteness seeks participants engaged in revisiting
modernist authors’ own self-representations, elisions, or sublimations of
whiteness; it also invites self-reflexive considerations of scholarly method,
pedagogy, and theory in modernist studies. </p>

<p></p>

<p>We invite participants to rearticulate modernist whitenesses
considering the ample evidence that, first, white dominance has always already
been a conversation in modernist communities: to name only US-based texts,
think of Nella Larsen’s <i>Passing</i> and James Baldwin’s <i>The Fire Next
Time</i>. In this context, to what extent do Nancy Cunard’s and Carl Van
Vechten’s works, to take only two instances, implicitly inscribe a particular
whiteness? In a larger frame, this seminar is informed by the vast field of
Whiteness Studies in which seminal works are now at least 25 years old. </p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar expands work on inclusion that MSA began in
prior conferences and meshes with the themes of MSA 2021 such as “translation,
transmission, transmediality, transnationalism, transgenderism, transraciality,
and transference.” We look forward to a dialogue that carries across areas of
the world as well as in diverse media and disciplines. As Matthew Frye Jacobson’s
<i>Whiteness of a Different Color</i> indicates, whiteness itself migrates,
changing shape depending on contexts, local or otherwise. When it comes to
racialized passing, for instance, the lines between forced and voluntary
migrations become blurred. </p>

<p>Participants may examine whiteness intersectionally as a
category produced dialectically with both its racialized and ethnicized “others,”
gender (especially masculinity), language, age, dis/ability, class, and
sexuality. We also encourage contributions that examine the heterogeneity of
whiteness or systems that enable or constrain the recognition of whiteness.
Comparatist approaches that decenter Anglophone cultural contexts, or analyses
that center aboriginal Australian, mixed-race Brazilian, or creole Caribbean
works are particularly welcome. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Participants may ask and respond to such questions as the
following: By what means can whiteness as a structuring element be rendered
(il)legible or (in)visible? When and why does whiteness disappear as a category
of analysis? How does terminology disguise or telegraph investments in
whiteness? By what processes are analyses of whiteness made theoretically,
institutionally, or politically inert? From which positions and vantage points
can “we” hear conversations about whiteness and how are these interventions
listened to, heard, or addressed?</p>

<p></p>


<p>The blasted landscapes of World
War I are often described by writers and diarists as <i>atomized</i> and <i>primeval</i>.
A focus on geologic reduction seems pervasive within Anglophone modernist works
responding to this particular crisis: twisted metal, jagged rocks, rent soil,
cracked earth, air aflame, thick suffocating muddy waters. How might we see
this elemental ecology as a trope or register particular to war-time or
large-scale socio-political crises of Modernism in general, beyond World War I?</p>

<p>Does it appear in the early feminist literatures and
political writings of suffragettes? What of those writing against the violence
of empire in its many forms? The rise of the new “urban jungle”? Labor
struggles, race riots, and their attendant political rhetorics and counter
protest writings?</p>

<p>This seminar seeks to interrogate exactly this matrix
of crises and their potentially elemental rhetorics and images, asking what
such tropologies make possible or legible, and what they foreclose and incite?
Situating itself within the trajectory of such new materialist scholars as
Jeffrey Cohen and Lowell Duckert, participants are invited to explore how
writers have used the elements throughout this period of increasing violence,
destruction, and catastrophe—social, military, and environmental—to mediate
individuals’ experiences of crisis for themselves and the potential
epistemological, ontological, and phenomenological crises they present for the
individuals’ relationship to the social and material world.</p>

<p>When we convene on the day, participants will be
invited to speak to and query each other’s pre-circulated work, as guided and
facilitated by the seminar leader. A small set of discussion questions focusing
on points of intersection and through lines across the papers will be
distributed for contemplation a few days before the seminar. Our aim will be to
spend at least 5-10 minutes generally focused on each person’s contribution—though
with much crosstalk encouraged, especially in the second hour.</p>

<p>“The better work men do is always done under stress and at
great personal cost”</p>

<p>—  William Carlos Williams, <i>Spring and All</i> (1923) </p>

<p></p>

<p>According to Enda Duffy, “stress is assuredly a modernist
invention, yet it has virtually never been mentioned, let alone theorized as a
topic in culture, by modernist scholars” (2015). This seminar invites
participants to look at the manifestations of physical and psychological
pressures in modernist works. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Although the use of the word “stress” to refer to a
psychological and physiological phenomenon only gained currency in the 1930s
and ’40s, the concept of a stress-response appeared as early as 1915 in the
research of Walter Cannon, in relation to fight-or-flight reactions. (The
concept of stress had previously been confined to the field of physics and
engineering.) Increasingly, the debate around the use of stress-induced energy
has become focused on normal and abnormal reactions to work: in an age where
energy is harnessed by machines and subjected to the demands of capitalist
production, stress urges us to become more attuned to the pressures of
productivity over minds and bodies. While Cannon focused on stress as an
adaptive response enabling mankind to confront emergencies, stress-induced
energy remains a disruption of emotional balance, which, if prolonged and left
unchecked, can affect physical and mental health. </p>

<p></p>

<p>From Pound’s advocacy of concentration against dispersal and
Eliot’s association of the artistic process with forms of “intensity” and “pressure,”
to Woolf’s and Joyce’s attention to the minute changes in their characters’
nervous states (to cite only a few all-to-canonical examples), modernist
literature is deeply preoccupied with the spending and wasting of surplus
energy, with the way bodies and minds react to various pressures, and with the
role of these pressures in the facilitating or inhibiting of artistic creation.

<p>This seminar considers new approaches to print and digital
scholarly editing in modernist studies. If, as David Greetham put it, “[t]he
history of textual scholarship is the history of history,” how has scholarly
editing shaped modernist studies, and how are new editions informing research
and teaching? What questions have modernist texts presented, and how have
editors addressed them? What editorial decisions have proved useful, and what
kinds of editions would readers like to see?</p>

<p></p>

<p>We invite participants interested in the creation and use of
scholarly editions, from those in the early stages of a project to those
teaching with print or digital editions. For seminar members working on or
having recently completed a project, what large- or small-scale issues have
emerged and how have you or your collaborators responded to them? What
questions remain, and what do they teach us about modernist studies? Other
topics for discussion may include, but are not limited to, print and digital
archives, working remotely, collaboration, locating and dating materials,

<h2><strong>Networks, Infrastructures, and Other Modernist
Passageways</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p>For the past thirty years, the network model has been
influential in modernist studies, especially as we seek a more inclusive
narrative of modernism. Weak theoretical turns and Digital Humanities projects,
especially those involving mapping, have recently renewed this model of
networked connections. At the same time, an “infrastructuralist” approach to
texts focusing on the often invisible material culture that undergirds modern
life—transportation networks, electrical grids, sewer systems, corridors and
passageways—has been developed through the work of Michael Rubenstein, Kate
Marshall, and Bruce Robbins among many others.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar asks what these critical explorations of
networks and infrastructures afford us when put into conversation. Networks and
infrastructures define at once analogous and opposed forms of modern
connectivity. Paul Edwards, for example, maintains that networks are “decentralized
and distributed” while infrastructures are “centralized and hierarchical”;
Caroline Levine, on the other hand, claims that “conventional infrastructures
are best described as networks” as both are “not repetitive but connective
forms.” Other theorists like Sara Ahmed complicate both paradigms in asking us
to consider “orientations” alongside connections. How can we conceive of
modernist networks that might connect global modernisms, feminism, queer
studies, and the many other approaches that have adopted a network model? Is
the network model too limiting to do justice to the varied and multiplicitous
migratory paths of modernism? Or is it so broad that such lived spatial
patterns of connectivity become potentially meaningless? How does a materialist
focus on infrastructure challenge or enhance these network narratives? We
solicit response papers that either 1) consider the limits and unmet potential
of modernist network narratives or infrastructures; or 2) consider how
modernist texts reify or reimagine the networked and/or infrastructural
connections of modernity.</p>

<p>In their introduction to <i>Decadence in the Age of
Modernism</i> (2019), Kate Hext and Alex Murray speak of the “dizzying
multiplicity of decadence in the early twentieth century” and the difficulty of
detecting, much less defining, decadence outside fin-de-siècle Europe. Rather
than shy away from that difficulty, this seminar seeks to explore new locations
for decadence, both in and beyond the modernist era, and across a more globally
extensive framework. While the subject of decadence has been treated within
modernist studies with some regularity since the mid-1990s, a new wave of
scholarship has brought decadence squarely to the center of our field, often
with the goal of re-evaluating its broader relationship to modernism and its
related literary and social movements. Recent works by Matthew Potolsky,
Vincent Sherry, Kristen Mahoney, Robert Stilling, Alex Murray, and Kate Hext,
for example, have demonstrated the persistent interest in decadent art and
writing, and the lasting influence of figures such as Wilde, Huysmans,
Beardsley, and Pater well past the1890s while challenging long-held
understandings of decadence as a characteristic set of traits. Indeed,
decadence studies has expanded in recent years to include range of
late-decadent, modernist, queer, and Harlem Renaissance texts, Hollywood films,
and colonial and postcolonial poetry and art.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the story of decadence as a modern aesthetic
mode remains dominated by its origin story in nineteenth-century France, while
the contributions of non-Western understandings of historical decline,
degeneration, or aesthetic decadence remain under-examined. By the same token,
how might decadence be understood as an aesthetic response, for example, to
colonialism, neo-colonialism, globalization, secularization, climate change,
global migration, rising illiberalism, and so forth? To support a conversation
centering on this recent expansion of decadence studies and the future
directions it might take, this seminar seeks papers that approach decadence
from new theoretical angles, compare well-known decadent texts to less
traditional ones, explore decadence’s relationship to and circulation through
various social contexts, locate decadence in or across new cultural, national,
geographic, and ecological spaces, or extend the temporal boundaries of
decadence beyond the fin de siècle. We invite work that addresses the arts,
film, and new media as well as literature, and we welcome both scholars with
considerable experience in this area and those who may be approaching decadence
for the first time.</p>

<h2><strong>Radical Domesticity</strong></h2>

<p>&quot;Away with Coziness! Only where comfort ends, does
humanity begin.&quot; (Adolf Behne)</p>

<p></p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought both pressure and
attention to domestic life, with homelessness and domestic violence on the
rise, more people spending more time at home than ever before, and increased
erosion of the separation between the spheres of home and work. Via Zoom and
similar platforms, domesticity has become a spectacle as never before.</p>

<p>The contemporary crisis in domestic life invites a
reconsideration of a parallel historical moment 100 years ago, when another
pandemic—in concert with other factors, such as the impact of WWI—led to a
significant revaluation of the scope, meaning, and shape of domestic life.
Modernism gave rise to many radical experiments in the domestic, despite its
outspoken repudiation of the comfortable and cozy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar offers an opportunity for us to consider
together about how radical domesticity helped set the agenda for modernism in
literature, theater, architecture and design, urban planning, and beyond.
Seminar contributors may want to think back as far as the mid-nineteenth
century, when social theorists like Fourier and Saint-Simon promulgated
experiments in group living that challenged the traditional family and gender
roles, or as far forward as 1960s domestic countercultures, or anywhere in
between. The seminar will look to foster and extend comparative discussions
about modernism across diverse forms of cultural production.</p>

<h2><strong>Pregnancy, Kinship, and Motion</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p>Pregnancy and kinship are
intimately bound up with notions of transmission, movement, and the “carrying
across” referenced in the conference theme: carrying the fetus until
parturition; the transmission of fluids between the fetus and the gestating
person; the passage of genetic matter through a family line; racist and ableist
laws designed to prevent transmission of “unfit” genetic matter into “fit”
genetic stock (as Dorothy Roberts states, “Antimiscegenation laws were a
eugenic measure”); the importance of quickening—the moment the pregnant person
first senses fetal movement—as a marker of fetal viability; or the process that
Erin Kingsley terms “gestational immigration,” which refers to the “physical
and psychological movement” that occurs when one becomes a parent.
Linguistically, too, reproductive processes are linked with the rhetoric of
motion. <i>Hysteria</i>, for instance, stems from the Greek word for “uterus,”
and early twentieth-century treatments for hysteria drew on ancient theories of
the “wandering womb” as a source of women’s ailments. Moreover, the word <i>travel
</i>stems from <i>travail</i>. Most frequently used today to refer to mental or
physical work, at earlier times <i>travail</i> referred specifically to
childbirth. As Joyce E. Kelley notes in her study of the ways modernist women
conceptualized travel as a catalyst for exploring creativity, the “personal ‘geographies’
of pregnancy” are underexplored.</p>

<p>This seminar seeks papers on all aspects of
reproduction as depicted in modernist literature. Papers that address
reproduction in context with motion, transmission, travel, or migration are
preferred. We invite work that considers queer reproduction, including
depictions of pregnant men and androgynous people. Possible topics include but
are not limited to:</p>

<h2><strong>The Modernist Scene</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p>This seminar will explore the
aesthetics and politics of modernism as they are expressed through scenes. Each
participant will present a paper that focuses on one scene in a specific
modernist text—whether film, theater, visual arts, literature, or other media.</p>

<p>The purpose of the seminar is, first, to think through
the various formal and social implications of the scene as a unit of aesthetic
expression. How does modernism across different media negotiate the formal
boundaries of a scene? How do we know when a scene has begun, when it has
ended? How can we account for the dual nature of scenes in narrative theory, as
both a suspension of diegetic movement and a site of narrative intrigue?
Second, we will consider the scenic in (or as) modernism. How does the category
of the scene, defined as it is by a logic of inclusion and exclusion, allow us
to appraise the shape and limits of the modernist scene—particularly as it
appears from the vantage of contemporary modernist studies? Finally, our
discussion will accommodate the gendered and aged valences of the scene in
modernism. As in the parlance of “making a scene,” the scene is associated with
irrationality and excess, cast as the dominion of women and the young—the
tantrum of a child, for example, or the theatrics of female hysteria.</p>

<p>We invite papers that are anchored by the discussion of
a specific modernist scene and that engage any or all of the above concerns.</p>

<h2><strong>Migration – Innovation – Labour</strong></h2>

<p>No migration without labour.</p>

<p>No “carrying across” without “carrying.” Whether we are
discussing the “trans-” of translation, transnationalism, transgender
identities, transference, or the coordinated movement of bodies through and
across space, we cannot avoid considering the laborious elements of crossing
through, changing over, passing beyond, or even going back. Can we “figure”
migration without attending to labour?</p>

<p>How does migration condition and affect the aesthetic
labour of modernist innovation? As a principle, or even an injunction, Ezra
Pound’s “make it new” still offers a helpful gloss on the political and
aesthetic demands of modernist projects in various forms. In the context of
this demand for newness, we might even see migration as the making modern of
modernism itself, in the propensities of crossing through, changing over,
passing beyond, or even going back to generate “new” material and metaphorical
configurations. What indeed is the status of “newness” in migration? Does
thinking of migration as a condition of modernist writing help us understand
its complex mediation of tradition?</p>

<p>In many ways, the “figuration” of labour can help us
better understand the connections between migration and modernist innovation.
As Gayatri Spivak notes in <i>An Aesthetic Education</i>: “Culture alive is
always on the run.” Indeed, movement as critical method in Spivak’s work
appropriates modernist themes for diverse purposes; see the “feminist shuttling”
between “capitalism as modernity and reproductive heteronormativity,” for
example. Or, consider Ishmael Reed’s 1972 novel <i>Mumbo Jumbo,</i> where the “Jes
Grew” dance-virus—aesthetic-innovation-become-involuntary-affliction—transposes
the aspirant formal and social freedoms of jazz into the discourse of racial
contagion, prompting reflection on the racial and capitalist logics of “carrying,”
and renewing thinking about the effortful dimension underlying the “virality”
of culture.</p>

<p>This seminar therefore promises an inter-disciplinary
conversation about the effortful and productive nature of migrations,
considered broadly. What are the intersections between the labour theory of
value, biopolitics, and deconstructions of the subject/subjectivity in
modernist writing, for example? How might a focus on the labour of migration
help us understand anew modernist critiques and explorations of “the subject,” “sovereignty,”
and “belonging,” in the context of political economy and the reproduction of
global capital?</p>

<h2><strong>Modernist Emo</strong></h2>

<p>From W. H. Auden’s “the age of anxiety” to our age of doomscrolling,
the global pandemic and various political protests compel us to examine
emotions’ transformative power more closely. Grounded in the premise that “all
politics is emotional” (Berlant), our seminar asks: how does modernism define
the interplay between political and aesthetic emotion? Immanuel Kant’s “feeling
of life,” Raymond Williams’s “structure of feeling,” Walter Benjamin’s “aura,”
Clive Bell’s “significant form”: these various concepts attempt to encapsulate
contemplative feelings about a work of art while also gesturing to a reflexive
awareness of one’s mode of relating to the social. In many of these cases, the
affective interaction between the work of art and the reader or viewer is not
enclosed in the individual, but exists to animate transformative social and
political action (see Jonathan Flatley, Sianne Ngai, Lauren Berlant, David
Kurnick, Ben Highmore, etc.). Broadly calling these felt responses and
interactions “aesthetic emotions,” this seminar invites participants to
consider what kinds of aesthetic emotions modernism theorizes, represents,
and/or embodies in relation to the political, the social, and the historical.
We welcome work that explores how modernist experimentation contributes to
alternative approaches to understanding aesthetic emotion (or inexpressibility
or failure of such emotion), and how modernist artworks mobilize
socio-political and materialist aspects of these vague yet specific feels
connected to art. Participants are encouraged to respond to the following
prompts, which will establish a shared set of concerns for our seminar:</p>

<p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          How do we think and feel
with the politics and ethics of aesthetic emotions produced or theorized by
modernist artworks?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          Besides negative, weak,
ambivalent emotions, does modernism also engage with affirmative, happy,
aggressive, and other emotions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          Does aesthetic emotion
become associated specifically with formalism in modernism, e.g. “the formal
relations between color and shapes that exist within the boundaries of the
frame,” in the words of Brian Glavey? What do “formal relations” mean for
different modernist media? Are aesthetic emotions medium specific?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          Despite their highly
subjective nature, thinkers of aesthetic theory have suggested the
universalizable qualities of aesthetic emotion and judgment. Is there a
contemporary version of this, such as in the affective turn of literary
studies?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          Does attuning ourselves
to aesthetic emotion raise methodological questions (different modes of reading
and looking)? For instance, does close reading produce different affective
valences than surface or distant reading?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          How do we conceptualize
aesthetic judgment when it comes to such a slippery notion as “aesthetic
emotion”? Does the locus of aesthetic emotion move from the body to the brain
with modernism? How do our interpretive practices account for felt modes of
aesthetic judgment that are ineffable/difficult to explain and justify to
others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          How do we understand the
relationship of aesthetic emotion to intellectual enjoyment and interpretative
pleasure in modernist studies (reading and interpreting “difficult texts,” for
example)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>●          What other questions
would emerge from our reorientation to aesthetic emotion? Does this
reorientation further unsettle the already plural and muddy definitions of
modernism?</p>

<h2><strong>Fostering Activists: A Seminar for the Modernist Scholar-Activist</strong></h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Leaders:</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:.2in'>J. Ashley Foster, California State University, Fresno</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the Annual International
Conference on Virginia Woolf in 2014, Mark Hussey posed a number of questions
to the opening plenary roundtable, one of the most poignant being: “Does
[Virginia] Woolf’s ‘thinking is my fighting’ really make a difference now?” As
many teacher-scholars consider themselves activists, following in the line of
Jane Marcus’s statement that “Literary criticism is inescapably political,” and
as the state of our profession goes deeper and deeper into crisis, the question
arises as to how these two elements—activism and the state of the profession—converge.
Celebrating the 20th anniversary of “The New Modernist Studies,” that panel at
2019’s Modernist Studies Association Conference, this was heavy on many
modernists' minds, as evidenced by challenges to the panelists by junior
scholars focused on the state of the profession and its future. This
conversation continued in the roundtables entitled “The Future of Modernist
Studies in the Age of Precarity” and “New Feminist Modernist Manifestos,” that
featured talks on “Angry Modernism,” Dark Modernism,” Sketchy Modernism,” and “Suffering
Modernism.” Anxieties over how to pivot from traditional scholar-teachers to
activists, both within the field and within the community, abound.</p>

<p>This seminar aims to achieve the following: 1.) a space
especially for graduate students, adjuncts, and community college modernist
scholars—but welcoming of all—to share the challenges of maintaining
scholarship and progressing through research in a waning hiring field; 2.) an
exchange and examination of institutional differences and obstacles to activism
and the development of strategies for organizing both inter and
intra-institutions; 3.) links to modernist activism as a means of historical
framing, inspiration, and fostering integration for young scholar-activists;
and 4.) accounts from and about this subject position and her struggles—and
triumphs—in the academy.</p>

<p>Led by Laura Hartmann-Villalta and J. Ashley Foster and
grounded in feminist approaches to networking, this seminar seeks to create an
informal, non-hierarchal space where participants leave with concrete
strategies that provide beacons of light for the precariat and establish
communication networks that go beyond their institutions.</p>

<p>“Fostering Activists: A Seminar for the Modernist
Scholar-Activist” asks participants to share 5-7 pages of a potential variety
of writing: reflective writing on their experiences or perceptions of union
organizing, protest, activism; manifestoes on how their teaching links to their
activism or scholarship; and scholarship on activism in modernist texts and
figures that reveal coping strategies and lessons learned from past encounters
in the modernist era. </p>

<p>We seek to create a feminist collective of
non-hierarchical voices, so no respondent or positions of prestige. Rather than
attempt to posit alternative-academic careers and a means out of the precariat
(although the seminar certainly encourages this route), this seminar wants
participants to share strategies for making it work in this position, not
burning out, keeping a scholarly agenda, and most importantly, organizing
across institutions for effective change and resistance. Individuals will leave
the seminar with next steps and an action plan that will be revisited in
workshop form at MSA 2022 in Portland.</p>
