Above, below, on every side, high shelved<br>
From careless grasp of transient interest,<br><br>
Stand books we can but dimly see, their charm<br>
Much greater that their titles are unread;<br>
While on a level with the dusty floor<br>
Others are ranged in orderly confusion,<br>
And we must stoop in painful posture while<br>
We read their names and learn their histories.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;--Amy Lowell, "Boston Athenium"
